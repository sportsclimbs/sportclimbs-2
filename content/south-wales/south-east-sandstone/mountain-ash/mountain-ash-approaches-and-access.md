![](/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/MMAP1.gif)![](/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/MMAP2.gif)This is a relatively easy cliff to find and is only 5 minutes walk from the car, or less! When approaching from the A470, Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil road, take a left turn (when coming from the south) at the main roundabout at Abercynon (this is the only roundabout that blocks the dual carriageway system 5 miles north of Pontypridd). Follow the A4059, signposted Aberdare, until 1mile after the Cynon Business Park you come into the village of Mountain Ash.

Take the first right by a prominent red telephone box and then immediately left. Take the first right (Newton Villas) and either park here or continue up the dirt track directly ahead to park alongside an old bonfire site. A short path zigzags up and slightly to the left into the secluded quarry entrance where the first walls will be immediately apparent to the left.

**WARNING:**  
It is advisable that all belongings are left undisplayed in the car since it may provoke any would-be junior criminals that pass your way. With this in mind, the best parking place remains in the side roads where cars remain a little more unobtrusive.
