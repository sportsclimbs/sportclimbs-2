Take the A4059 to Mountain Ash and turn left into the town centre at the town hall. Turn right at the traffic lights and travel through Abercwmboi until after a mile an obvious left turn is taken, signposted for Cwmaman. Follow this road to a cross-roads and turn left into Jubilee Road. Follow this road for 1 mile and just after the Shepherd's Arms take the third left. This roads goes down a short steep hill and around a left-hand bend onto Llanwonno Road. Continue up this for 100 yards, then take a left by a water treatment works to arrive at a parking space alongside twin cottages. From here follow the obvious track for 50 yards from where a steep track on the right leads into the quarry.
