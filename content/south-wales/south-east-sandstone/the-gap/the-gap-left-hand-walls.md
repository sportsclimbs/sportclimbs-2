![The Gap topo of the LH walls](/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/The-Gap-left1-copy.jpg)
{.topo .w100}

This fine wall, often gaining more sunshine than the rest of the quarry offers a series of worthwhile pitches in the lower end of the sport grades. The right-hand section of the wall can be slightly hollow but the abundance of in-situ gear renders this problem surmountable. A good place to learn 'sport climbing'.

**1. As it Was (5)**  
This climbs the short wall on left. Describes the pre-bolt ethic, hence the name and gear: hinges, scrap metal, this one has the lot including an impressive scaffolding pole.
{.mt0}

**2. Kabuto Mushi (6a+)**  
A short wall with 2PRs.
{.rebolted}

**Duster (5+)**  
The crack right of *Kabuto*.

**3. Yikes (6b+)**  
A short hard wall. Problematic and snatchy on small holds.

**Muster (6a)**  
Climb up right of *Yikes* by a tree.

**4. So Uncool (6c) *★★***  
The best route on the wall with a fingery start and sustained moves above. A spotter might be a good idea.

**5. Just Hanging Around E1 5b *★***  
An excellent traditional crackline with BB on left. 

**6. Fluster (6a+) *★***  
This is the first line on the wall to the right of the crack. It's slightly hollow but pleasant enough.

**7. Bluster (6b) *★***  
Similar to *Fluster*, though less technical.

**8. Marlin on the Wall (6a+) *★***  
Fingery and technical. The 'marlin' adds a new dimension to the word protection. Safer than a house.

**9. Don't Blame Me (6b)**  
Good climbing on edges though can remain damp.

**10. Sumo no Shiro (6b+)**  
A popular route which climbs up the green streak. Sometimes a little dusty and therefore not as good as the rest.

There are two new routes right of *Sumo*. The first follows the corner line and is 6a. The second goes up via a blank wall and is 6a+.
