            <p>The centrepiece of the quarry providing some of the best wall pitches on sandstone.</p>

            <p><b>1. Loctite (7b) &starf;</b> desperate fingery climbing on the edges low down. No coming in from the side.</p>
            <p><b>2. Land of the Dinosaurs E3 5c &starf;</b> almost situ-gear crack but a Friend 2 is useful. Harder than it looks and a notable cleaning achievement in its day.</p>
            <p><b>3. Momentary Lapse of Reason 7b+ &starf;&starf;</b> superb sustained climbing of the typically fingery nature sandstone lends itself to. Finish at the last BR, not the BB.</p>
            <p><b>4. Rattle Those Tusks E3 5c &starf;</b> more classic-style crack climbing. Some nuts and Friends needed.</p>
            <p><b>5. Mad at the Sun (7c) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> the hardest route on sandstone to date. And look at the date! Fingery, sustained and technical.</p>
            <p><b>6. Unnamed (6c) &starf;</b> shallow groove and short headwall above start of 'Sun'.</p>
            <p><b>7. Bear Running, Salmon Cunning (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> right-hand side of arete to slab. Difficult finish on the headwall.</p>
            <p><b>8. Anything You Can Do (7b) &starf;&starf;</b> excellent open wall climbing. A blind and fingery crux with an airy headwall above.</p>
            <p><b>9. Encore Magnifique (7b+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> the sandstone classic of its grade. Sustained more than technical and maybe only 7b. But you can keep it at 7b+ for now.</p>
            <p><b>10. Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> typical of the wall: steep and fingery but with an unusual crossover crux. Now started direct.</p>
