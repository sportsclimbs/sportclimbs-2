![Encore crag topo](/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/Encore-crag-shot.jpg)
{.topo .w100}

The centrepiece of the quarry providing some of the best wall pitches on sandstone.

**1. Loctite (7b) *★***  
Desperate fingery climbing on the edges low down. Coming in from the side is not allowed.
{.mt0}

**2. Land of the Dinosaurs (6b) *★***  
Climbs the crack. Harder than it looks and a notable cleaning achievement in its day. Can be extended by moving left from the belay and going up to the belay on *Loctite* at 6c.

**3. Momentary Lapse of Reason (7b+) *★★***  
Superb, sustained climbing of the typically fingery nature sandstone lends itself to. Finish at the last BR, not the BB.

**Enter Sandaman (7c+) *★★***  
An extension to the previous route past the roof to finish at an obvious jug. Better to jump back down than trust the old belay!

**A Momentary Right-hand Treason (7b+)**  
An eliminate line between the *Momentary Lapse* and the next. Originally climbed above a pad with the first 2 bolts of the previous route pre-clipped.

**4. Rattle Those Tusks (6b) *★★***  
An old trad route that's become very popular since retrobolting giving some classic-style crack climbing.

**5. Mad at the Sun (7c) *★★★***  
One of the hardest routes on sandstone, first climbed in 1990. Start up *Leave it to Me*, traverse left and up the face to finish over the roof. Fingery, sustained and technical.

**6. Leave it to Me (6c) *★***  
The shallow groove and short headwall above start of *Mad at the Sun*.

**7. Salmon Running, Bear Cunning  (7a) *★★***  
Climb the right-hand side of arête and the slab above with a difficult finish on the headwall. There is also a **Right-hand finish (7a)** &starf; and an extension **John West (7b)** that climbs past the BB to higher BB.

**8. Anything You Can Do (7b) *★★***  
Excellent open wall climbing. A blind and fingery crux with an airy headwall above. The direct finish is **I Can Do Better (7b) ★★**.  

**9. Encore Magnifique (7b+) *★★★***  
The sandstone classic of its grade. Sustained more than technical and maybe only 7b. But you can keep it at 7b+ for now.

**10. Pleasant Valley Sunday (7a+) *★★***  
A typical example of this wall: steep and fingery but with an unusual crossover crux. Now started direct.

You can climb *PVS* into *Encore* at worthwhile 7b.
