            <p><b>1. Newton's Apple E1 5b &starf;</b> very pleasant easy-angled face, 2PRs.</p>
            <p><b>2. Dirty Girty HVS 4c</b> Jam, jam, jam.</p>
            <p><b>3. Acceleration due to Gravity HVS 5a</b> the curving thin crack. Pleasant and better than its neighbour.</p>
            <p><b>4. It's a Sine (6a+)</b> enjoyable face left of large corner. <i>The hue slimy corner provides the line of Trident.</i></p>
            <p><b>5. Scared Seal Banter (7a+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> superb, overhanging wall climbing. Fingery and sustained.</p>
            <p><b>6. The Mastick Mick (6c+) &starf; </b>a good intro to uphill country.</p>
            <p><b>7. Cled's Crack E1 5a</b> the wide traditional crack.</p>
            <p><b>8. The Grouts of San Romano (6c) &starf;</b> technical 'match-edge' start to a steep finish. Friend 3 useful.</p>
            <p><b>9. Brush Up HVS 5a</b> the right-hand corner of the bay, PR.</p>
            <p><b>10. Step Up E1 5a</b> the obvious S-shaped crack, PR.</p>
            <p><b>11. Godfather E2 5b &starf;</b> left-hand arete of tower. Airy</p>
            <p><b>12. Up Yours! E1 5b &starf;&starf;</b> the right-hand arete. Superb, photogenic etc, etc, etc</p>
            <p><b>13. Smoothie HVS 5c</b> tricky bulge and short wall.</p>

            <p>Further over to the right are a couple of pleasant routes: <b>Windy Ridge (E1 5a)</b> is the obvious arete with a PR and <b>O Solo Mio (HVS 5a)</b> climbs a short wall on the opposite side of the gap. There a re a few other problems to sample in the area alongside these routes. </p>
