**1. Newton's Apple E1 5b *★***  
A very pleasant easy-angled face, 2PRs.

**2. Dirty Girty HVS 4c**  
Jam, jam, jam.

**3. Acceleration due to Gravity HVS 5a**  
The curving thin crack is pleasant and better than its neighbour.

**4. It's a Sine (6a+)**  
An enjoyable face climb left of large corner.  The hue slimy corner provides the line of **Trident**.

**5. Scared Seal Banter (7a+) *★★★***  
A superb, overhanging wall climb. Fingery and sustained.

**6. The Mastick Mick (6c+) *★***  
A good introduction to uphill country.

**7. Cled's Crack E1 5a**  
The wide traditional crack.

**8. The Grouts of San Romano (6c) *★***  
A technical 'match-edge' start takes you to a steep finish. Friend 3 useful.

**8. The Grouts of San Romano Right-hand (6c+) *★***  
Clip the bolt above the handrail on the previous route before breaking out to climb the wall on the right and stretching left to clip the bolts.

**9. Brush Up HVS 5a**  
The right-hand corner of the bay, PR.

**10. Step Up E1 5a**  
The obvious S-shaped crack, PR.

**Listen to Uncle (6b)**  
Climb the wall left of *The Godfather* to a shared ring lower off.

**11. The Godfather (6a+) *★***  
The left-hand arete of tower provides so airy climbing.

**12. Up Yours! (6a) *★★***  
The right-hand arete proved superb, photogenic climbing.

**13. Smoothie HVS 5c**  
The tricky bulge and short wall.

Further over to the right are a couple of pleasant routes: **Windy Edge (E1 5a)** is the obvious arete with a PR, **Mortar Life (6a)** is the bolt line to the right and **O Solo Mio (HVS 5a)** climbs a short wall on the opposite side of the gap. There a re a few other problems to sample in the area alongside these routes.
