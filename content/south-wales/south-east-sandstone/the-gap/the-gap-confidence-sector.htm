            <p>A fine area with a variety of excellent, easier sport routes via a series of pillars, walls and well-grouted roofs.</p>

            <p><b>1. Canine League (6b) &starf;</b> first line through roof right of corner. Good climbing with a pumpy roof.</p>
            <p><b>2. Sleeping Dogs (6b+) &starf;&starf; </b>a superb route via the juggy handrail and the right-hand side of the roof. Classic.</p>
            <p><b>3. Don't Bark Yet (6c) </b>New line finishing via overlap</p>
            <p><b>4. Smack yer bitch up (6b+) </b>side wall of corner and face above.</p>
            <p><b>5. Generation Gap E1 5b</b> very pleasant climbing in traditional mode starting up the left edge of the pillar. </p>
            <p><b>6. Mister Faraday (6b) &starf;</b> a good introduction to the cliff. A short stubborn start with fine climbing above.</p>
            <p><b>7. A Poker in the Eye (6b) &starf;&starf;</b> fine route, strenuous at the grade. Take the roof and storm the walls above.</p>
            <p><b>8. Grout Expectations (6a) &starf;</b> pleasant easier line to the right.</p>
            <p><b>9. Shackles of Love (6b)</b> crack, wall and shallow groove to the right. Not outstanding.</p>
            <p><b>10. Ring of Confidence (6b) &starf;</b> low-level flakes and wall on right to the top. Hollow high up but worthwhile.</p>
            <p><b>11. Get Flossed (7a+) &starf;</b> squeezed in but quite a tough cookie if climbed direct. Avoid good holds on left at grade. </p>
