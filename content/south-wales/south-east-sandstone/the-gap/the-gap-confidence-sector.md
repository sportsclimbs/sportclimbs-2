{.topo .w100}

A fine area with a variety of excellent, easier sport routes via a series of pillars, walls and well-grouted roofs.

**1. Canine League (6b) *★***  
The first line through roof right of corner. Good climbing with a pumpy roof.
{.mt0}

**2. Sleeping Dogs (6b+) *★★***  
Great climbing through the juggy handrail and the right-hand side of the roof. A classic.

**3. Don't Bark Yet (6c)**  
A newer line that finishes via overlap.

**4. Smack My Bitch Up (6b+)**  
Climb the side wall of corner and then the face above.

**Generation Bitch (6b)**  
Climb the slab of *Generation Gap* and climb direct through the centre of the overlap to finish up *Smack My Bitch Up*.

**5. Generation Gap (5c)**  
Very pleasant climbing in traditional mode. Start up the left edge of the pillar and follow the right-hand line of bolts.

**6. Mister Faraday (6b) *★***  
A good introduction to the cliff. A short stubborn start rewards with fine climbing above.

**7. A Poker in the Eye (6b) *★★***  
A fine route that's strenuous at the grade. Pull through the roof and then storm the walls above.

**8. Grout Expectations (6a) *★***  
This pleasant easier line is to the right.

**9. Shackles of Love (6b)**  
Climb the crack, wall and shallow groove to the right. Not outstanding.

**Fill that Gap (6a+)** 
Climbs the crack. Some loose rock. Needs more traffic to clean up.

**10. Ring of Confidence (6b) *★***  
Climb up flakes and the wall on right to the top. Hollow high up but worthwhile.

**11. Get Flossed (7a+) *★***  
This is a bit squeezed in but quite a tough cookie if climbed direct. Avoid good holds on left at this grade.
