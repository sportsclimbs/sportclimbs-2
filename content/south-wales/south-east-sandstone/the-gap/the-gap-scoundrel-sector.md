The bay at the right-hand side of the quarry provides a liberal smattering of routes with four of particular merit.
{.csa}

**1. One Track Mind (6c+) *★***  
A fine arete.
{.mt0}

**2. Greased Balls (6b+)**  
The left wall of the corner.

**3. Rain and Tears E1 5b**  
The corner. Unpopular.

**4. Full Bag E2 5b**  
The crack striking right from the corner.

**5. Controlled Emission (6b+) *★★***  
The first line of BRs on the wall to the right has fine climbing and one of the classics. Sustained and a long reach helps.

**6. Sperm Wail (7a+) *★★***  
A fingery and technical wall with hidden small edges.

**7. Scrotum Oil (6c) *★★***  
Another well-bolted pitch that's very popular. Again a long reach helps on the hidden holds.

**8. Naked Truth HVS 5a**  
Another traditional crack climb.

**Bareface Cheek (6a+)**  
The bolt line right of the previous route. May need a dusting before climbing.

**9. Pick up the Pieces (6b)**  
Pleasant climbing up the final slim wall. Back to BRs for this one.

**10. Retro But In E1 5b**  
The less obvious crack in the right wall.

**11. Perfect Scoundrels (6c) *★★***  
An excellent roof and arete. It's pumpy through roof and pleasantly technical above providing a good mixture.

**12. Butt Out (5+)**

**13. Per Rectum (4+)**  
Climbs up via the small tower.

**Stool Sample (5)**

**As it Is (5+)**  
The final short arete with modern gear.

**Turd Strangler (6c+)**

**Di Horrea (6b)**
