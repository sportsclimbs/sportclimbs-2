## Left-Hand Buttress

{.topo .w100}


 A little down the hillside, towards the Lower Quarry, is a flat-faced buttress of around 9m in height. The two central routes offer well-protected climbing whilst the arêtes are a bolder proposition. Good rock throughout with the odd peg runner here and there.

**1. First there is a Mountain E4 5c**  
Bold climbing up the rounded arête. A pocket on the left may provide the key.

**2. Trouble at Mill E3 5c *★***  
The left-hand line on the front face is 'controversial'. PR.

**3. Luddite E3 6a *★***  
The right-hand line on the front face. Another controversial PR.

**4. Then There is a Mountain E4 5c**  
Yet more boldness up the right-hand side of the wall to reach the arête towards the top.

## Right-Hand Buttress

Working leftwards from the Upper Quarry a series of natural buttresses will be seen. The right-hand buttress offers some good climbing, though only the best routes are included here. Mostly natural protection though the odd peg runner is present.

**1. New tricks E1 5c**

**2. In Over My Head E3 6b *★***  
A direct line up to and through rock fang features small holds and technical climbing.

**3. Mister Natural E1 5c**  
The obvious bulging crack.

**4. Surprise, Surprise E1 5c**  
A natural crack with unnatural holds, PR.

**5. Audio Pornography E3 5c *★***  
An excellent flat-faced wall with PR. Relatively bold but excellent.
