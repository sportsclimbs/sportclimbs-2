                A little down the hillside, towards the Lower Quarry, is a flat-faced buttress of around 9m in height. The two central routes offer well-protected climbing whilst the aretes are a bolder proposition. Good rock throughout with the odd peg runner here and there.</p>

            <p><b>1. First there is a Mountain E4 5c</b> bold climbing on the rounded arete. A pocket on the left may provide the key.</p>
            <p><b>2. Trouble at Mill E3 5c &starf;</b> the left-hand line on the front face. Controversial PR.</p>
            <p><b>3. Luddite E3 6a &starf;</b> the right-hand line on the front face. Another controversial PR.</p>
            <p><b>4. Then There is a Mountain E4 5c</b> y et more boldness up the right-hand side of the wall to reach the arete towards the top.</p>

            <h2>Right-Hand Buttress</h2>

            <p><img src="/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/NATRH.gif" width="365" height="184">Working leftwards from the Upper Quarry a series of natural buttresses will be seen. The right-hand buttress offers some good climbing, though only the best routes are included here. Mostly natural protection though the odd peg runner is present.</p>
            <p><b>1. New tricks E1 5c</b> steep wall just right of crack, PR. Pleasant.</p>
            <p><b>2. In Over My Head E3 6b &starf;</b> direct to and through rock fang. Very small holds. Technical</p>
            <p><b>3. Mister Natural E1 5c</b> obvious bulging crack.</p>
            <p><b>4. Surprise, Surprise E1 5c</b> natural crack with unnatural holds, PR.</p>
            <p><b>5. Audio Pornography E3 5c &starf;</b> excellent flat-faced wall with PR. Relatively bold but excellent.</p>
