            <p>The bay at the right-hand side of the quarry provides a liberal smattering of routes with four of particular merit.</p>
            <p><b>1. One Track Mind (6c+) &starf;</b> Fine arete. <span class="new">Now Bolted</span></p>
            <p><b>2. Greased Balls (6b+)</b> the left wall of the corner.</p>
            <p><b>3. Rain and Tears E1 5b</b> the corner. Unpopular.</p>
            <p><b>4. Full Bag E2 5b</b> crack striking right from the corner.</p>
            <p><b>5. Controlled Emission (6b+) &starf;&starf;</b> first line of BRs on the wall to the right. Fine climbing and quickly becoming a classic. Sustained where a long reach helps.</p>
            <p><b>6. Sperm Wail (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> Fingery and technical wall with hidden small edges. <span class="new">Now Bolted</span></p>
            <p><b>7. Scrotum Oil (6c) &starf;&starf;</b> another well-bolted pitch fully gaining a popular status. Again a long reach helps on the hidden holds.</p>
            <p><b>8. Naked Truth HVS 5a</b> another traditional crack climb.</p>
            <p><b>9. Pick up the Pieces (6b)</b> pleasant climbing up the final slim wall. Back to BRs for this one.</p>
            <p><b>10. Retro But In E1 5b</b> the less obvious crack in the right wall.</p>
            <p><b>11. Perfect Scoundrels (6c) &starf;&starf;</b> excellent roof and arete. Pumpy through roof, pleasantly technical above. A good mixture.</p>
            <p><b>12. Butt Out (5+) </b></p>
            <p><b>13. Per Rectum (4+) </b>via small tower<b>Stool Sample (5)</b></p>
            <p><b>As it Is (5+)</b> the final short arete with modern gear. </p>
            <p><b>Turd Strangler (6c+)</b></p>
            <p><b>Di Horrea (6b) </b></p>
