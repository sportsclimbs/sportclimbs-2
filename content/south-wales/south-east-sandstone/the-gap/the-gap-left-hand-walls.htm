            <p>This fine wall, often gaining more sunshine than the rest of the quarry offers a series of worthwhile pitches in the lower end of the sport grades. The right-hand section of the wall can be slightly hollow but the abundance of in-situ gear renders this problem surmountable. A good place to learn 'sport climbing'.</p>

            <p><b>1. As it Was VS 4c</b> short wall on left. Describes the pre-bolt ethic, hence the name and gear: hinges, scrap metal, this one has the lot including an impressive scaffolding pole.</p>
            <p><b>2. Mitsubisho E1 5c</b> short wall with 2PRs. </p>
            <p><b>3. Yikes (6b+)</b> short hard wall. Problematic and snatchy on small holds. </p>
            <p><b>4. So Uncool (6c) &starf;&starf;</b> the best route on the wall. Fingery start, spotters advised, with sustained moves above. </p>
            <p><b>5. Just Hanging Around E1 5b &starf;</b> excellent traditional crackline with BB on left. Standard rack. </p>
            <p><b>6. Fluster (6a+) &starf; </b>first line on the wall to the right of the crack. Slightly hollow but pleasant enough. </p>
            <p><b>7. Bluster (6b) &starf;</b> similar to Fluster, though not as technical on one move. </p>
            <p><b>8. Marlin on the Wall (6b) &starf;</b> fingery and technical. The 'marlin' adds a new dimension to the word protection. Safer than a house.</p>
            <p><b>9. Unnamed (6b) </b>New line direct up wall. </p>
            <p><b>10. Sumo no Shiro (6b+)</b> another popular route up the green streak. Sometimes a little dusty and therefore not as good as the rest.</p>
