            <p>Another super little find in the Welsh valleys with a plethora of good routes throughout the grade ranges. A big crag clean up took place here and the net result is a very enjoyable venue with ease of access and user-friendly routes.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>There are 2 ways to approach this crag.</p>

            <p>1. If coming from Pontypool/Blaenavon. Turn off the A4043 into Pontnewynydd Industrial Estate follow this road to a T junction just past the Post office sorting depot. Turn left up the hill along the road passing the Plas y Coed pub on your left; continue straight on the road which becomes lined with ancient beech trees. About 150m further along on the right-hand side are the 2 old entrances to what was Tirpentwys Tip. Park in either.</p>

            <p>2. When approaching from Crumlin, turn left off the A472 in Hafodyrynys and then take the road that runs down the side of the Chinese takeaway. After about 70m, fork right up the steep hill and go around the hairpin bend to pass the Star inn on your left. Cross over a cattle grid, where the road levels out and continue straight on crossing a second cattle grid passing the houses of Pantygasseg on your left as you follow the road down the hill. The 2 entrances to the old tip are on your left in about 250m.</p>

            <p>From the parking area go through the green metal barrier, the top entrance, onto the tarmac road and follow this for about 200m until it bends to the right; at this point go straight on following the gravel road passing a footbridge on your left after 150m. 50m after this, cross the small drainage ditch on the right, the crag will now be visible approximately 100m on the right. There is a style fixed to the fence to allow easy access.</p>
