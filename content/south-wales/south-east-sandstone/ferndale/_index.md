A super little crag with a number of excellent face routes that dry quickly for maximum effect. Since the publication of the Rockfax guide the crag has seen a resurgence in development with a number of routes across the grade spectrum making it well worth a visit. The crag faces east and gets the morning sun, although a few of the wall do get sun later in the day.

## Approach

The quarry is best approached from Porth in the south. Take the A4233 into Ferndale and in the centre of the village, where the road doglegs to the right, turn left and up the hill slightly. Where the road begins to level out a path will be seen on the left whilst the pavement on the right widens enough for two cars to be parked: this is by a public footpath descending some steps. (Please park carefully).

Follow the path up the hillside and turn down and left through a metal gate. Continue for 50m and then take a vague path up and right into the beginning of the quarry. The routes are over to the left.
