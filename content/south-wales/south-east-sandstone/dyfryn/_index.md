## Introduction

![Dyfryn map](/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/dyfryn-1st-but.jpg)![](/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/dyfren3.jpg)A new crag with fabulous views of Swansea bay and the Neath Valley. A good venue for the 6a/6b climber in a sunny woodland setting. Do not put the climbing at risk by driving on the Woodland Trust tracks but park up either behind the church or the farm and make the pleasant 15 min walk to the crag: this also saves wrecking your tyres and suspension.

The cliff faces south-east and receives only morning sunshine.

## Approach

Take junction 43 on the M4 to Neath ,turn off the A465 at the first round about. Go left to the next roundabout and turn left again at the Tesco roundabout towards Skewen. At the second mini roundabouts take a right turn up the hill to Longford - this is Longford Lane. After negotiating the "tank traps" follow the lane for 2 miles until just after the Church. On the sharp right hand bend take a left turn signed for The Grange. Park almost immediately by Forest gates or continue past the Grange, a sharp right turn, onto the farm. The track ahead takes two switch backs to reach the crag. **Please do not drive up to here and threaten access.**
