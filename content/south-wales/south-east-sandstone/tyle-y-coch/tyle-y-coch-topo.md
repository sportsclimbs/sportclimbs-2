**1. Lilly of the Valleys (3)**  
slabby line at RH side of crag.

**2. Jumping Jack Flash (4+)**  
short orange wall to left

**3. Enema of the Affair (6c) *★★***  
the arete with excellent moves.

**4. High Moon (6b) *★***  
the steep face to the left. Good.

**5. Suppose a Tree (4)**  
a narrow corner to the left again.

**6. Buen Cuol (4)**  
short wall to left, generally easing in angle.

**7. Mal Cule (4)**  
a vague corner then via overlap and slabby wall.

**8. The Ring (3)**  
direct from Mal Cule via a 'prow' of rock

**9. Bore Hole (3)**  
the obvious line of bore holes to the left

The crag now becomes much more impressive with a large sandstone wall which does, unfortunately, take a while to dry out in the Spring.

**10. Cheeky Arete Severe**  
the obvious arete with a single PR.

**11. The Big Tissue (6b+)**  
the overlap 2m to the left finishing via the wall above.

**12. Peachy (6b+) *★***  
the wall to the left via a jutting hold and a borehole. The overlap above provides the difficulties.

**13. Mislivings (6c+) *★★***  
a peculiar leftwards line across the overlap to a final bulging finish.

**14. Paradise Row (6c+) *★***  
gains the finish of mislivings via the fine wall to its left. Again the finish provides the crux.

**15. The Pink Lady (6c) *★***  
the centre of the wall trending rightwards via an incipient crackline

**16. A Cleft Stick (7a) *★***  
steps left out of Pink Lady then via an overlap and tricky finale on the headwall.

**17. Belly Up (7a+) *★★***  
a vague crackline via a hole and another difficult and fingery finale on the headwall.

**18. Root Canal E1 5b**  
the naturally protected corner line.

**19. Rump and Scoop (6a) *★***  
the arete on the left

**20. The Black Circular Cat E3 5c *★***  
from LH side of the face gains a ledge. R to ramp and up to corner. Move out right to finish, feet on ramp

**21. The Postman E2 5c**  
gains a thin crack and continues right across the face to finish via a corner exiting left.

**22. Pecker Patrol E1 5b**  
left edge of wall via a PR moving right to finish
