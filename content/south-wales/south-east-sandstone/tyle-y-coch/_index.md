A super little find by John James and Wayne Gladwyn with a few offerings from Gordon Jenkin and Gary Gibson, this little quarry is well worth visiting the area for if in search of some easier sport climbs or the typically meaty leaning walls so associated with South Wales Sandstone.

The only distraction the quarry has are that the harder routes can take a while to dry out and the valley where it belongs does not have vast amounts of other walls worth visiting. This is compromised by its wonderfully quiet nature and the artistic talent embroidered on one of the trees marking the approach.

## Approach

Exit the M4 at junction 28 and follow the A467 to the Halfmoon, Sirhowy/Crosskeys roundabout. Here take the A467 again, the third exit, to Newbridge. Follow this, taking the third turning on the left after a miniature roundabout at Pontywaun and into the village of Westend. Pass through the village and the Crown public house on the left. After half a kilometre past the houses a long lay-by on the left is reached.

Walk back down the hill for 30m or so to below a painted icon of the local area, the Pink Ladies rear end. Walk up the hillside above this to reach an old and disused railway track. Follow this leftwards until the quarry can be seen just above, sometimes disguised by the trees.
