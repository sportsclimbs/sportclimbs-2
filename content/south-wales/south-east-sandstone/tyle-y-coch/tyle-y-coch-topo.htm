            <p><b>1. Lilly of the Valleys (3) </b>slabby line at RH side of crag.</p>
            <p><b>2. Jumping Jack Flash (4+) </b>short orange wall to left</p>
            <p><b>3. Enema of the Affair (6c) &starf;&starf; </b>the arete with excellent moves.</p>
            <p><b>4. High Moon (6b) &starf; </b>the steep face to the left. Good.</p>
            <p><b>5. Suppose a Tree (4) </b>a narrow corner to the left again.</p>
            <p><b>6. Buen Cuol (4) </b>short wall to left, generally easing in angle.</p>
            <p><b>7. Mal Cule (4) </b>a vague corner then via overlap and slabby wall.</p>
            <p><b>8. The Ring (3) </b>direct from Mal Cule via a 'prow' of rock</p>
            <p><b>9. Bore Hole (3) </b>the obvious line of bore holes to the left</p>
            <p>The crag now becomes much more impressive with a large sandstone wall which does, unfortunately, take a while to dry out in the Spring.</p>
            <p><b>10. Cheeky Arete Severe </b>the obvious arete with a single PR.</p>
            <p><b> 11. The Big Tissue (6b+) </b>the overlap 2m to the left finishing via the wall above.</p>
            <p><b>12. Peachy (6b+) &starf; </b>the wall to the left via a jutting hold and a borehole. The overlap above provides the difficulties.</p>
            <p><b>13. Mislivings (6c+) &starf;&starf; </b>a peculiar leftwards line across the overlap to a final bulging finish.</p>
            <p><b>14. Paradise Row (6c+) &starf; </b>gains the finish of mislivings via the fine wall to its left. Again the finish provides the crux.</p>
            <p><b>15. The Pink Lady (6c) &starf; </b>the centre of the wall trending rightwards via an incipient crackline</p>
            <p><b>16. A Cleft Stick (7a) &starf; </b>steps left out of Pink Lady then via an overlap and tricky finale on the headwall.</p>
            <p><b>17. Belly Up (7a+) &starf;&starf; </b>a vague crackline via a hole and another difficult and fingery finale on the headwall.</p>
            <p><b>18. Root Canal E1 5b</b> the naturally protected corner line.</p>
            <p><b>19. Rump and Scoop (6a) &starf; </b>the arete on the left</p>
            <p><b>20. The Black Circular Cat E3 5c &starf; </b>from LH side of the face gains a ledge. R to ramp and up to corner. Move out right to finish, feet on ramp</p>
            <p><b>21. The Postman E2 5c </b>gains a thin crack and continues right across the face to finish via a corner exiting left.</p>
            <p><b>22. Pecker Patrol E1 5b </b>left edge of wall via a PR moving right to finish</p>
