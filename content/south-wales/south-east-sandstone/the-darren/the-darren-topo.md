**1. Smack (6c) *★***  
Small arête in the bay left of The Terminally Overhanging Wall. Strangely bolted.

The Terminally Overhanging Wall
-------------------------------

The wall has quite a mixture of pitches and to help identification even the traditional routes are included.

**2. Arizona Stan (7a+) *★★***  
Excellent taster of the wall's climbs. A short and sharp bouldering-style exercise

**3. Capstan (7b) *★★★***  
The natural continuation. A superb sustained effort with lots and lots of good moves.

**4. The Basildon Snapper (7b) *★★***  
Another excellent pumping line to get your fingers going.

**5. Alive and Kicking E5 6a**  
Traditional line up the wobbling crackline. BR!

**6. Down and Out (7a+) *★★***  
Typical of the wall, what isn't? Never hard but always sustained and pumpy. Very worthwhile.

**7. Rise (7a+) *★★***  
Now regeared and again very good.

**8. Sharpy Unplugged (7b+) *★★★***  
The route of the wall giving superb, sustained climbing.

**9. Enter the Darren E4 6a *★***  
Traditional crackline on right-hand side of wall.

The Bat Wall
------------

Only a few bolted routes but worth including for completeness.

**10. Sorry Lorry Morry (6c) *★***  
Pleasant face climbing via shallow groove.

**11. Juvenile Justice E4 6b *★***  
Bald slap with bad low clip, hence grade.

**12. Shaken but not Stirred (6c+**) Short test-piece on right-hand side of wall.

**13. Madame X (7a)**  
The arête to the right.
