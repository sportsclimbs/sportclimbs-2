            <p><b>1. Smack (6c) &starf;</b> Small arete in the bay left of The Terminally Overhanging Wall. Strangely bolted.</p>

            <h2>The Terminally Overhanging Wall</h2>

            <p>The wall has quite a mixture of pitches and to help identification even the traditional routes are included.</p>

            <p><b>2. Arizona Stan (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> Excellent taster of the wall's climbs. A short and sharp bouldering-style exercise</p>
            <p><b>3. Capstan (7b) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> The natural continuation. A superb sustained effort with lots and lots of good moves. </p>
            <p><b>4. The Basildon Snapper (7b) &starf;&starf; </b>Another excellent pumping line to get your fingers going. </p>
            <p><b>5. Alive and Kicking E5 6a </b>Traditional line up the wobbling crackline. BR!</p>
            <p><b>6. Down and Out (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> Typical of the wall, what isn't? Never hard but always sustained and pumpy. Very worthwhile. </p>
            <p><b>7. Rise (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> Now regeared and again very good. </p>
            <p><b>8. Sharpy Unplugged (7b+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> The route of the wall giving superb, sustained climbing. </p>
            <p><b>9. Enter the Darren E4 6a &starf;</b> Traditional crackline on right-hand side of wall. </p>

            <h2>The Bat Wall</h2>

            <p>Only a few bolted routes but worth including for completeness.</p>

            <p><b>10. Sorry Lorry Morry (6c) &starf;</b> Pleasant face climbing via shallow groove.</p>
            <p><b>11. Juvenile Justice E4 6b &starf;</b> Bald slap with bad low clip, hence grade. </p>
            <p><b>12. Shaken but not Stirred (6c+</b>) Short test-piece on right-hand side of wall.</p>
            <p><b>13. Madame X (7a)</b> The arete to the right. </p>
