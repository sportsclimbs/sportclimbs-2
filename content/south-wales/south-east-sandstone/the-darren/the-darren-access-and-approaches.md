![dar1](/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/DAR1.gif)This is a little complicated but when combined with the map is relatively straightforward.

![dar3](/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/DAR3.gif)When travelling along the A470, Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil road, take the exit marked Ynysybwl into Pontypridd. Follow this road round until it runs right and take the first left signposted for Whiterock Estate. Turn left into Graigwen Place at the top, then take the first right and follow the road steeply up the hill for half a milel. Turn right into Whiterock Avenue, then the first left into hiterock Place and then the first left again into Lanwood Road.

Park 50 yards along this road at a path between a bungalow and a house. Follow this path turning right behind the house until it rises into the quarry bay at the end.
