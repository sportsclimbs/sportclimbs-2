This small quarry, recently cleaned and redeveloped, situated near to Cross keys and Sirhowy. It gives a number of worthwhile sport routes, with a few trad routes thrown in for good measure on a series of arete, towers and corners. It is an ideal winter venue due to its south-facing nature.

Approach
--------

From junction 28 of the M4, follow the A467 to where it veers off left into Sirhowy Country Park. Take the right here, not for Wattsville but for Cross Keys and follow this road until a roundabout laden with a large figure of a mountain Bike. Turn right here and take the first left towards Cwmcarn Follow this road taking the fourth right opposite to the Cwmcarn hotel. Park in this road just beyond Tribute Street. Walk up Tribute Street for 200 yards and take a path on the left into a rack which leads right past some garages. Follow this track steeply and direct into the quarry.
