The walls to the right, whilst continuing to retain their height, provide in the main a number of excellent short pitches for a winter's day. These are intermingled with the occasional longer route.

**1. The Missing Quarter (6b+) *★***  
Climb the blunt rib just right of the wall containing *Roaring Forties*. Pleasant slab climbing all the way to the top of the crag.

**2. Saboo (6c)**  
The shallow groove system is a little fragile.

**3. Dandelion (6b)**  
Pleasant shallow grooves and the wall above. A little fragile in places and suffers from seepage.

**4. Burdock (6b)**  
Climb the wall just left of the main angle of the bay.

**5. Blinded by Love (6c+) *★★***  
Superb sustained climbing on the stepped arête.

**6. The Laughing Policeman (6b+) *★***  
The crack and groove system starting via difficult rib. Suffers from seepage at the start of the route, hence climbing the rib on the right.

**7. Fair Cop (6b+) *★***  
The crack, wall and flying arête. A long sustained pitch with a technical start to the wall and an 'out there' finish.

**8. Aptitude Test (7a) *★***  
The desperately technical, blunt, low-level arête.

**9. The Merthyr Infill (6c) *★***  
A short technical and worthwhile wall.

**10. My Blue Bell (6b)★**  
Climb up a shallow groove with an awkward bulge.

**11. All Sand Together (6c+)**  
This takes a blunt rib with short, steep section. Move right at 3rd BR into *Red 'erring*.

**12. Red 'erring (6b+) *★***  
Climb up the steep pink wall and bulge to a bold and rounded finish.

**13. Plaque Attack (6c) *★***  
Provides some technical climbing up the angled face.

**14. Incidentally (6b+)**  
Climb the arête of wall moving left to the belay.

**15. Cop the Lot (7a)**  
This takes the blunt rib on other side of a dirty groove. It has a hard finish.

**16. The Caerphilly Cop Out (6c+) *★***  
Another blunt rib with a l-o-n-g reach and short difficult face.

**17. I Am What I Am (6b) *★★***  
The left-hand of three longer routes this climbs a shallow groove and open face.  Excellent sustained climbing with a crux finish. Well bolted.

**18. You Are What You Is (6c) *★***  
The central line of open face with the hardest climbing at the start. Excellent.

**19. Is it What You are That is? (6c+)★★**  
Takes the arête of wall. The crux is lowdown and middle section is sportingly bolted.

**20. The Brush Down (7a) *★***  
The left-hand line of two routes has a hard starting wall.

**21. The Brush Off (7a) *★***  
The right-hand line is slightly harder at the start and the finish.

**My Little Rooty Wooty (6a+) *★***  
This pleasant face is a way over to right.
