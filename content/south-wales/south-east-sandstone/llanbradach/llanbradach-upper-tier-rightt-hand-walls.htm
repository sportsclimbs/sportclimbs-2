            <p>The walls to the right, whilst continuing to retain their height, provide in the main a number of excellent short pitches for a winter's day. These are intermingled with the occasional longer route.</p>

            <p><b>1. The Missing Quarter (6b+) *</b> blunt rib just right of the wall containing Roaring Forties. Pleasant slab climbing all the way to the top of the crag.</p>
            <p><b>2. Saboo (6c)</b> the shallow groove system is a little fragile.</p>
            <p><b>3. Dandelion (6b) </b>pleasant shallow groove system and the wall above. A little fragile in places and suffers from seepage.</p>
            <p><b>4. Burdock (6b)</b> the wall just left of the main angle of the bay.</p>
            <p><b>5. Blinded by Love (6c+) **</b> superb sustained climbing on the stepped arete.</p>
            <p><b>6. The Laughing Policeman (6b+) *</b> crack and groove system starting via difficult rib. Suffers seepage at the start of the route, hence climbing the rib on the right.</p>
            <p><b>7. Fair Cop (6b+) *</b> c rack, wall and flying arete. A long sustained pitch with a technical start to the wall and an 'out there' finish.</p>
            <p><b>8. Aptitude Test (7a) *</b> desperately technical blunt low-level arete.</p>
            <p><b>9. The Merthyr Infill (6c) *</b> short technical and worthwhile wall.</p>
            <p><b>10. My Blue Bell (6b)*</b> shallow groove with an awkward bulge.</p>
            <p><b>11. All Sand Together (6c+)</b>blunt rib with short steep section. Move right at 3rd BR into Red 'erring.</p>
            <p><b>12. Red 'erring (6b+) *</b> steep pink wall, bulge and bold rounded finale.</p>
            <p><b>13. Plaque Attack (6c) *</b> technical climbing up angled face.</p>
            <p><b>14. Incidentally (6b+)</b> arete of wall moving left to belay.</p>
            <p><b>15. Cop the Lot (7a)</b> blunt rib on other side of dirty groove to a hard finish.</p>
            <p><b>16. The Caerphilly Cop Out (6c+) *</b> blunt rib, l-o-n-g reach and short difficult face.</p>
            <p><b>17. I Am What I Am (6b) **</b> shallow groove and open face, the left-hand of three longer routes. Excellent sustained face climbing with a crux finish. Well bolted.</p>
            <p><b>18. You Are What You Is (6c) *</b> central line of open face. Crux start, excellent.</p>
            <p><b>19. Is it What You are That is? (6c+)**</b> arete of wall with a low crux and sportingly bolted middle section.</p>
            <p><b>20. The Brush Down (7a) * </b>left-hand line of two to right with hard starting wall.</p>
            <p><b>21. The Brush Off (7a) * </b>right-hand line, slightly harder at the start and finish.</p>
            <p><b>My LIttle Rooty Wooty (6a+) </b>* pleasant face way over to right.</p>
