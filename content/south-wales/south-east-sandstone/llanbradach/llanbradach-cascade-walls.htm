            <p>These two sections of wall actually provide the lower section of cliff below the Expansionist Walls. Good Quality routes with the overflow (cascade) usually evident. Grooves and faces abound. Gets any sunshine until 1pm.</p>

            <p><b>The Sub-Contract Wall</b> The left-hand face with four worthwhile routes.</p>
            <p><b>1. Sub-Contraction (7a)</b> left arete of wall. Single desperate move.</p>
            <p><b>2. Simple Addition (6c) &starf;&starf;</b> flat wall seemed with pockets. Sustained.</p>
            <p><b>3. Post Expressionist (6b)</b> the centre of the wall via a prominent flake. Pleasant.</p>
            <p><b>4. Too Keynes by Half (6c) &starf;</b> excellent sustained climbing up the right edge of the wall. Treat the start with kid gloves.</p>
            <p><b>5. Falling Freely (7a+) &starf;</b> leftwards up prominent red wall. Fingery and on good rock. Any wetness at the start can be avoided.</p>
            <p><b>6. Splashdown (6c+)</b> prominent leftwards groove exiting right to belay. Take care at the start. Fingery</p>
            <p><b>7. Total Recoil (6b+) &starf;</b> varied route with short crux wall. Can be linked to upper wall routes via ledge and slab.</p>
            <p><b>8. Cascade (6c+) &starf;</b> technical face with overlap. Fingery</p>
            <p><b>9. Sphagnum 45 (6b)</b> groove and wall above spring.</p>
            <p><b>10. Right of Spring (6c+) &starf;</b> starts just right of stream and trends leftwards. Airy final clip.</p>
            <p><b>12. Bathtime (6c)</b> flat face. Hard move from obvious ledge at half height. </p>
