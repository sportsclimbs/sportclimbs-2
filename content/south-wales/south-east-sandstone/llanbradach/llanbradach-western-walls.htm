            <p>Two sections at the far end of the lower quarry provide a handful of quality routes. Their only true distraction is their north-facing nature, otherwise they are well worth a visit.</p>

            <h2>The Left-hand Walls</h2>

            <p>Characterised by a prominent arete and a superb clean sheet of wall.</p>

            <p>The prominent open corner-line of Exhumation is clearly visible from the opposite side of the quarry.</p>
