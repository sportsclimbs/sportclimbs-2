These two sections of wall actually provide the lower section of cliff below the Expansionist Walls. Good Quality routes with the overflow (cascade) usually evident. Grooves and faces abound. Gets any sunshine until 1pm.

**The Sub-Contract Wall**  
The left-hand face with four worthwhile routes.
{.mt0}

**1. Sub-Contraction (7a)**  
The left arête of wall. Single desperate move.

**2. Simple Addition (6c) *★★***  
Climb the flat wall seamed with pockets. Sustained.

**3. Post Expressionist (6b)**  
The centre of the wall via a prominent flake. Pleasant.

**4. Too Keynes by Half (6c) *★***  
Excellent sustained climbing up the right edge of the wall. Treat the start with kid gloves.

**5. Falling Freely (7a+) *★***  
A leftwards line up prominent red wall. Fingery and on good rock. Any wetness at the start can be avoided.

**6. Splashdown (6c+)**  
Climb the prominent leftwards groove exiting right to belay. Take care at the start. Fingery.

**7. Total Recoil (6b+) *★***  
A varied route with a short crux wall. Can be linked to upper wall routes via ledge and slab.

**8. Cascade (6c+) *★***  
A technical face with an overlap. Fingery.

**9. Sphagnum 45 (6b)**  
Climb the groove and wall above the spring.

**10. Right of Spring (6c+) *★***  
Start just right of stream and trends leftwards. This has an airy final clip.

**12. Bathtime (6c)**  
The flat face with a hard move from obvious ledge at half height.
