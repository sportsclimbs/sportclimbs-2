            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This cliff is a relatively new find on the edge of Abertwssyg village in the Tredegar Valley. It is an isolated position but its west-facing nature and open aspect give the cliff an impressive air with a pleasant atmosphere looking down the entire valley.</p>
            <p>The routes are currently situated on two good walls but there are others available for development which should happen in the near future.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>Take the A469 north from Ystrad Mynech, or south from the 'Heads of the Valley' road to the village of Pontlottyn. Turn right here, or left when coming from the north, under a bridge and then take the second right for Abertwssyg. Follow this road through Abertwssyg past the first sharp bend to a left-hand hairpin bend. Park here.</p>
            <p>Walk into the quarry via the upper track, the lower track leads to more buttresses at the far end of the quarry, and after 300m spot a track on the left leading u the hillside. Follow this and then contour right below the crags to reach them. The first wall is obvious whilst the second one is a little further on above an excellent platform.</p>
