**1. Gott in Himmel (7a+) *★***  
Short fingery desperate with easier upper wall.

**2. Butcher Heinrich (7b) *★★***  
Superb, technical face climbing on small holds. A long reach helps.

**3. Strange Little Girl (6c) *★***  
Good climbing via the obvious crack. A good warm up.

**4. 'King Ada (7b) *★★***  
Fine wall climbing with a frustrating crux. The best move on the wall.

**5. Skanderbag (7b) *★★***  
Typical of the face. Excellent clean wall climbing but this time with a low technical crux.

**6. King Zog (7a+) *★★***  
Superb. Starts via flake/crack to finish slightly left via a desperate move over the 'smooth band'.

**7. Face (7b) *★★***  
Best route on the wall via a reachy start, an overlap and technical finish.

**8. Mawr, Mawr, Mawr (6c+) *★***  
Direct climbing via the obvious intermittent crackline.

**9. The Crimson King (7a) *★***  
Wall just left of tree finishing leftwards to belay of Mawr, Mawr, Mawr. Hard start and fingery finish.

**10. Sunstone (7a)**  
wall behind tree stump with fingery start and finale

**11. VIP Lunge (6c+) *★***  
First line right of tree with trying start.

The wall just left of the prominent arête

Right-hand arête of wall.
