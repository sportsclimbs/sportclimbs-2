Face (7b), The Rust Curtain.
{.photo}

A very fine wall, affectionately known as The Rust Curtain, situated in the tranquil Sirhowy Country Park 6 miles north of the M4. The wall lies only 50 yards walk from the car which makes it the ideal venue for the less pedestrian of climbers.  
The face is littered with a host of very compact and technical test-pieces, the easiest route being at E3. It faces west and gets any afternoon sun going but does suffer the dreaded seepage problem during the winter months.

## Access

This could prove to be a delicate issue. Approaches have been made in writing to the owners of the land but a response was not forthcoming. If asked to leave please do so courteously.

In respect of this, the best time to climb here may prove to be in an evening when the park wardens have departed for the day.

## Approach

â€¦could not be simpler. Take a right turn at junction 28 on the M4 and follow the A467 dual carriageway north, initially signposted Risca, to the fourth roundabout. Take the first left (signposted Full Moon Industrial Estate) and the road leads directly into the Sirhowy Country Park. The wall is just beyond the final parking place. **Note: the barriers on the Park often close early but the times for closure are posted on the noticeboard at the entrance to the park.**
