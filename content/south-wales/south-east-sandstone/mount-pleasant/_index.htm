            <p>A new find on the hillside opposite to the Gap with a plethora of excellent low grade sport climbs. The quarry has yet to reach its full potential but has plenty to offer those operating at that grade.</p>

            <h3>Aspect</h3>

            <p>The quarry faces west and gets any afternoon sunshine going. It dries very quickly save for one or two of the cracklines in the roofs.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>When travelling from the south, turn right off the roundabout on the A470 and take the first left into Quaker's Yard. This road continues, the A4054,through Edwardsville into the the village of Mount Pleasant: park on the left when entering the village.</p>
            <p>Walk back down the road towards Edwardsville for 300m until the quarry track on the left-can be seen with a gate across. This leads steeply and directly into the quarry. </p>

            <h3>Access</h3>

            <p>No access problems have yet arisen though it is best to park in the village for reasons of safety.</p>
