{.topo .w100}

**1. Bunk Her (6c) *★***  
From the top of bank. Direct and fingery with a tough, mid-height, crux.

**2. Golf Whore (6c) *★***  
Another worthwhile pitch. Steep, sustained without one hard move.

**3. Chip And Putt (6c+) *★***A line via a boxed-in recess and steep crackline. Hard, and with some controversial holds. Quit an exercise.

**4. Money (7a+) *★***  
Desperate moves on clean headwall.

**5. Time for Tee (6b+) *★★***  
Classic. Sustained. A low crux and strenuous mid-height bulge.

**6. Fairway To Heaven (6c+) *★★***  
The hard classic of the crag. The low bulge is awkward and the route has a finish that will surprise you.

**7. Golf Bag (7a)**  
Appropriate name. Short, scruffy desperate.

**8. Golf Syndrome (7a) *★***  
Short, sharp and surprising. Packs a punch!

**9. Project**

**10. Poisonous Little Toad (7b)**  
Hideous move over overlap. Wire needed for first BR.

**11. Caddy Lack E1 5b**  
The obvious arête on left of the bay.

**12. Nibble My Niblicks (6b+)**  
Short scruffy wall and crack. Awkward.
