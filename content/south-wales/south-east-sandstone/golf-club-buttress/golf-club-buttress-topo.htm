            <p><b>1. Bunk Her (6c) *</b> From the top of bank. Direct and fingery with a tough, mid-height, crux. </p>
            <p><b>2. Golf Whore (6c) *</b> Another worthwhile pitch. Steep, sustained without one hard move. </p>
            <p><b>3. Chip And Putt (6c+) *</b>A line via a boxed-in recess and steep crackline. Hard, and with some controversial holds. Quit an exercise. </p>
            <p><b>4. Money (7a+) *</b> Desperate moves on clean headwall. </p>
            <p><b>5. Time for Tee (6b+) **</b> Classic. Sustained. A low crux and strenuous mid-height bulge. </p>
            <p><b>6. Fairway To Heaven (6c+) **</b> The hard classic of the crag. The low bulge is awkward and the route has a finish that will surprise you. </p>
            <p><b>7. Golf Bag (7a)</b> Appropriate name. Short, scruffy desperate. </p>
            <p><b>8. Golf Syndrome (7a) *</b> Short, sharp and surprising. Packs a punch! </p>
            <p><b>9. Project</b></p>
            <p><b>10. Poisonous Little Toad (7b)</b> Hideous move over overlap. Wire needed for first BR.</p>
            <p><b>11. Caddy Lack E1 5b</b>The obvious arete on left of the bay. </p>
            <p><b>12. Nibble My Niblicks (6b+)</b> Short scruffy wall and crack. Awkward. </p>
