**7. Darcy's Dark Delights (7c)★** the difficult wall directly above the little pond

**8. Darcy's Discharge Velocity (7b+) ★★** only slightly more amenable to the right.

**9. Project**

**10. Darcy Gets Arcy (6b) ★★★** the layback corner and wall above. Superb.

**11. Bridget Jones Non Diary (7a+) ★** the wall to the right is a little devious.

**12. Good Morning Mr Darcy (6b+) ★** the arete gives a very good pitch.

**13. Darcy's Done Drilling (7a) ★** the line just right of the arete.

**16. Darcy Dallies with lower Life Forms (6a+) ★★** the wall left of the arete.

**17. The Destiny of Darcy Dancer (5+) ★** the obvious arete line on the right - no line of topo.
