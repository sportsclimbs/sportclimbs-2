**1. Flying arête (5+)**  
The obvious arête high up after a reasonable start.

Climb up via the alcove and a headwall littered in ..... Excellent.

A variant left-hand start on the next route.

Ledges marked by threads leading to a high corner.

Steep and juggy and pleasant through the roof.

The corner above the pond and headwall above.

**7. Darcy's Dark Delights (7c)★***  
The difficult wall directly above the little pond.

**8. Darcy's Discharge Velocity (7b+) *★★***  
Only slightly more amenable to the right.

**9. Project**

**10. Darcy Gets Arcy (6b) *★★★***  
The layback corner and wall above. Superb.

**11. Bridget Jones Non Diary (7a+) *★***  
The wall to the right is a little devious.

**12. Good Morning Mr Darcy (6b+) *★***  
The arête gives a very good pitch.

**13. Darcy's Done Drilling (7a) *★***  
The line just right of the arête.

**14. Darcy Despairs of procrastinators (6b) *★★★***  
The thin crack leading onto the headwall. Perhaps the best sport route of its grade in SE Wales?

**15. Dozy Darcy (6b) *★***  
The shallow groove and overlap.

**16. Darcy Dallies with lower Life Forms (6a+) *★★***  
The wall left of the arête.

**17. The Destiny of Darcy Dancer (5+) *★***  
The obvious arête line on the right - no line of topo.
