Introduction
------------

A superb new find in the village of Llandarcy with very easy access, numerous good routes, a short walk and in the sun for most of the day. The climbs have cleaned up considerably and whilst some remain damp well into the spring, it has already become very popular.

Approaches
----------

Turn off the M4 at junction 43, signposted Neath (A465) and turn south onto the B 4290 Llandarcy. Take a left at the first set of lights and then the first right within 150m. The Osprey training ground will now be on the left. Take the second right, Tank Farm Road, and the crag is 400m up here on the right.

Access
------

No right of access has been granted so if asked to leave by St Modwen, please do so courteously.
