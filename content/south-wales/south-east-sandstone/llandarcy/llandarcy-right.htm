            <p><b>1. Flying Arete (5+) </b>the obvious arete high up after a reasonable start</p>
            <p><b>2. Darcy Juggles Jugs (6a) ** </b>up via the alcove and a headwall littered in ..... Excellent.</p>
            <p><b>3. Darcy' Detour (5) </b>a variant left-hand start on the next route</p>
            <p><b>4. Dick Darcy (5) </b>ledges marked by threads leading to a high corner</p>
            <p><b>5. Darcy Takes it Easy (4+) </b>steep and juggy and pleasant through the roof</p>
            <p><b>6. Darcy Likes it Wet (6b) ** </b>the corner above the pond and headwall above.</p>

            <p><b>7. Darcy's Dark Delights (7c)* </b>the difficult wall directly above the little pond</p>
            <p><b>8. Darcy's Discharge Velocity (7b+) ** </b>only slightly more amenable to the right.</p>
            <p><b>9. Project</b></p>
            <p><b>10. Darcy Gets Arcy (6b) *** </b>the layback corner and wall above. Superb.</p>
            <p><b>11. Bridget Jones Non Diary (7a+) * </b>the wall to the right is a little devious.</p>
            <p><b>12. Good Morning Mr Darcy (6b+) * </b>the arete gives a very good pitch.</p>
            <p><b>13. Darcy's Done Drilling (7a) * </b>the line just right of the arete.</p>
            <p><b>14. Darcy Despairs of procrastinators (6b) *** </b>the thin crack leading onto the headwall. Perhaps the best sport route of its grade in SE Wales?</p>
            <p><b>15. Dozy Darcy (6b) * </b>the shallow groove and overlap.</p>
            <p><b>16. Darcy Dallies with lower Life Forms (6a+) ** </b>the wall left of the arete.</p>
            <p><b>17. The Destiny of Darcy Dancer (5+) * </b>the obvious arete line on the right - no line of topo. </p>
