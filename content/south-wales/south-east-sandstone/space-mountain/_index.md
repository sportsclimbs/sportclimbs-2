One of the biggest cliffs in the area, Space Mountain certainly has a mountain feel to it. The views are superb and the ambience is unspoilt, except for the village bingo caller on Sundays.

The main wall contains long, steep routes, supplied with good holds. Some of the steeper routes even stay dry in the rain.

Midges are a pest in the summer, but by late August they disappear. It gets sun in the morning, until mid afternoon. Its elevation means it will often be in the cloud on overcast days.

## Access

From the bus turning circle parking spot in Blaencwm, follow a level(ish) grassed path from the bus stop into a meadow (75 m). Turn left to sass the small-holding buildings on your left, as you go uphill to meet a stream in the top right corner of the open area. Follow a narrow path alongside a stream to meet a wooden bridge (100m). 20 m past the bridge is a steep and very narrow path directly uphill, follow this until you meet an old tramway. Cross the tramway via a level path leading off to the right. After only 10 m, cut steeply uphill (left) on a poorly defined path, with cairns, through the conifers.

After about 400 m, the left end of the cliff is reached. Take a moment to stand in awe as your eye is drawn to the ever larger walls to the right.
