![Space Mountain's Left Wing](/img/south-wales/south-east-sandstone/space-mountain-left-wing.jpg)

The left wing contains routes more akin to the standard sandstone that locals are accustomed to. 

**1. Will's Open Project**  
Bolt stubs left of crack, BYO hangers. 13 m

**2. Puny Earthling  (6c) *&starf;***  
Step up the black wall to a roof stack. Layback the blunt arête above (avoid the dirty, loose and dead end groove to its left, which somehow everyone thinks is the line until it is too late) and follow a horizontal line of jugs leading rightwards to a rock-up for the L.O. 13 m

**3. Bat Country - (E3 5b) *&starf;***  
A sustained route. Starts hand, then into into finger crack. Crimpy headwall wall with hard to spot peg up and right. Shares L.O with previous route.

**4. Absolutely Vabulous (6a+) *&starf;***  
Red layback to crack and belay in upper bay. 15 m

**5. Jungle Jizz Formula  (6b)**  
Crack and continuation of the L side of massive perched triangular block. 15 m

**6. The Rocketeer  (6b+) *&starf;***  
Boltline though the big low roof then the big high roof. 15 m

**7. Super-Dimensional Love Gun  (6a/6a+)**  
Staples up the black wall immediately left of the offwidth crack. Follow a diagonal right to left line. Starts and finishes further across than the bolt placements suggest. 13 m

**8. The Beast and the Harlot  (7a)**  
Steep, sustained and fingery black wall, right of the off-width. Climbs to the right of the staples on the upper wall. 17 m

**9. Synyster Gates (E1 5b)**  
The under cut flake is followed rightwards to the roof. Traverse left to finish up another obvious crack in the headwall. 15 m

**10. Sidewinder  (6c+/7a) *&starf;***  
Stapled black wall with technical difficulties concentrated around the strip roof. 16 m

**11. Black Thought (6a+) *&starf;***  
Last climb on the left wing. Follow a sharp arête to a ledge and the slab above, keeping left of the loose vegetated corner. 12 m
