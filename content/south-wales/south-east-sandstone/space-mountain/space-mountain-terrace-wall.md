## Terrace Wall

The very tall slab above the bloc. As there are currently concerns over a nearby peregrine's nest, so keep off the upper tier until the end of August.


**Asylum of Glass (E2 5b)**  
Bravely climbs the wide angular groove on left hand side of the slab, above The Bloc. Scramble left across pinnacle/flake ledge to step into the base of the hanging groove. Climb the left side of groove, up a wedged flake. Step right, then up to a flake on the left, surmount this, climb right and up into a crystal covered crack on right. Move left to a flake and climb up and right to below a steep cracked wall, which leads to good earthy holds and a spike. A couple of pulls on heather finishes the job. Tree abseil. 20m

**Luna Dust (6a+)**  
Left hand bolt line to the terrace. 15 m

**Luna Dust Extension (6b)**  
Continuation bolts above the terrace and left of the crack. 28 m.

**Dark Side of the Moon (E1)**  
The crack, starting at the half height terrace and Luna Dust Lower off. 15 m.

**Luna Shadow (6a)**  
Right hand bolt line to half height terrace lower off. 15 m.

## The Bloc

The obvious huge boulder at the right side of the crag, with a sweet lawn and shade from a big fir tree. When you have finished, lower off and collect your top quick-draw by scuttling around the bloc and reaching down from above.


**Donut Patrol (Mod)**  
The arête / narrow groove on the left side of The Bloc.

**Voyager 2 (5)**  
Left hand bolt-line up The Bloc. 8 m

**Crack for Carers (Severe)**  
The diagonal crack on the left side of The Bloc.

**Church of the Cosmic Skull (5+)**  
Central bolt-line of The Bloc. 8 m

**General Sherman and the Pink Cougar (5)**  
Right hand bolt-line up The Bloc, past the bonsai fir tree. 8 m

**Granny's Growler (Severe)**  
The orange inset corner/slab. 6 m

**Outta Space - (6b+)**  
Right side of the arête, a boulder problem with bolts. 6 m
