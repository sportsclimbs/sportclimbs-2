**Doom-Stack - Fr. 6a *&starf;***  
Corner chimney and fist crack above. Traditional style. 12 m

Closed Project (Jet Black Heart) - Fr.
Arête and roofs right of Doom-Stack

**Biological Jiu-Jitsu - Fr. 6c *&starf;&starf;***  
Corner to roof. Step left across slab to finish. 13 m

**Beyond the Black Rainbow (A.K.A. Dusty Anus) - Fr. 7a *&starf;&starf;***  
Start on the backwall of the cave. Follow the crack to an easier finish. 13 m.

**Closed Project (All Muscle No Hustle)**  
Hangers meet Dusty Anus.

**Achilles Last Stand - Fr. 6c *&starf;***  
Stiff start on the right side of the arête accesses easier ground. An airy traverse rightwards on the hanging slab accesses the arête finish. Shared L.O. easily reached around to the right. 13m

**Slayers Gate - Fr. 7a *&starf;&starf;***  
Start a couple of metres right of the arête. Climb the overhanging groove to meet the right side of the arête proper. Mantle out. 12 m

**The Dunning-Kruger Effect - Fr. 6b+/6c *&starf;***  
Steep, but supplied with good holds. Break out of the groove to meet the bulging wall and steps. A tricky final cross-through move leftwards gains the L.O. 12 m
