            <p><b>Community Spirit (5+) </b>the pedestal and wall leading to ledge finishing in a groove</p>
            <p><b>Ta-Ta Tata (5+) </b>open groove and V chimney</p>
            <p><b>CND (5+) </b>layback finishing up right-hand side of arete.</p>
            <p><b>1. Bone Hard Start (6a) </b>a tough start then the left-hand side of the arete. The right side of the arete is Anne's Stiff Entry (6a)</p>
            <p><b>2. Closed Shop E2 5c &starf;</b> Leftwards ramp and a series of thin cracks, PR. A good sampler of things to come. </p>
            <p><b>3. Restricted Practices E3 5c &starf;&starf;</b> Thin crack and wall with moves right into Closed Shop. Getting better. </p>
            <p><b>4. Gaz 316 (6b+) &starf; </b>the face above the overlap. Excellent.</p>
            <p><b>5. Crack Basher E3 5c &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> The obvious crackline provides the best route on the crag. Superb climbing, some say in the next grade bracket of the Es.</p>
            <p><b>6. Sign of the Times (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> Crack, flake and crack on the left at the top. The best of the hard routes on the crag with sustained face climbing throughout. Superb. </p>
            <p><b>7. PR Job (7a)</b> The direct start to Urban Development. </p>
            <p><b>8. Urban Development (7a) &starf;</b> Another fine pitch climbing a series of leftwards-slanting cracks in the wall. Cruxy.</p>
            <p><b>9. Fe 500 (7a+) </b>a more direct version of Urban Development utilising the arete.</p>
            <p><b>10. Writings on the Wall E3 5c</b> Hanging groove and leaf of rock from start of Urban Development, PR. Pleasant.</p>
            <p><b>11. Project</b></p>
            <p><b>12. Split the Equity E2 5b</b> Steep flake line above small cave. </p>
            <p><b>13. Hot Mill (7a+) &starf; </b>Obvious line to the right via 3BRs to BB. Technical </p>
            <p><b>15. Pig Iron (6c+) </b>the shallow groove system. Grit with bolts!</p>
            <p><b>High Jinx (6b) </b>the crack right of Pig Iron gained from the same start</p>
            <p><b>Mudlark Crack (6a+) </b>often wet crack right again</p>
            <p><b>16. Schmisse (6c+) </b>the corner and sinuous crack system right again</p>
            <p><b>Industrial Relations E1 5b</b> Corner and crack line in tower. </p>
            <p><b>17. Chain Reaction (6b) </b>the slabby and gnarly groove.</p>
            <p><b>18. Cold Rolled (6c+) </b>Isolated, steep slab on right</p>
            <p><b>19. Nether Edge (7b)</b> Short arete with desperate rock-over.</p>
