**Community Spirit (5+)**  
The pedestal and wall leading to ledge finishing in a groove

**Ta-Ta Tata (5+)**  
Open groove and V chimney

**CND (5+)**  
Layback finishing up right-hand side of arête.

**1. Bone Hard Start (6a)**  
A tough start then the left-hand side of the arête. The right side of the arête is Anne's Stiff Entry (6a)

**2. Closed Shop E2 5c *★***  
Leftwards ramp and a series of thin cracks, PR. A good sampler of things to come.

**3. Restricted Practices E3 5c *★★***  
Thin crack and wall with moves right into Closed Shop. Getting better.

**4. Gaz 316 (6b+) *★***  
The face above the overlap. Excellent.

**5. Crack Basher E3 5c *★★★***  
The obvious crackline provides the best route on the crag. Superb climbing, some say in the next grade bracket of the Es.

**6. Sign of the Times (7a) *★★***  
Crack, flake and crack on the left at the top. The best of the hard routes on the crag with sustained face climbing throughout. Superb.

**7. PR Job (7a)**  
The direct start to Urban Development.

**8. Urban Development (7a) *★***  
Another fine pitch climbing a series of leftwards-slanting cracks in the wall. Cruxy.

**9. Fe 500 (7a+)**  
A more direct version of Urban Development utilising the arête.

**10. Writings on the Wall E3 5c**  
Hanging groove and leaf of rock from start of Urban Development, PR. Pleasant.

**11. Project**

**12. Split the Equity E2 5b**  
Steep flake line above small cave.

**13. Hot Mill (7a+) *★***  
Obvious line to the right via 3BRs to BB. Technical

**15. Pig Iron (6c+)**  
The shallow groove system. Grit with bolts!

**High Jinx (6b)**  
The crack right of Pig Iron gained from the same start

**Mudlark Crack (6a+)**  
Often wet crack right again

**16. Schmisse (6c+)**  
The corner and sinuous crack system right again

**Industrial Relations E1 5b**  
Corner and crack line in tower.

**17. Chain Reaction (6b)**  
The slabby and gnarly groove.

**18. Cold Rolled (6c+)**  
Isolated, steep slab on right

**19. Nether Edge (7b)**  
Short arête with desperate rock-over.
