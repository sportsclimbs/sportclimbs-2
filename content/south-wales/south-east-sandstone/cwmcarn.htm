            <p>This small quarry, recently cleaned and redeveloped, situated near to Cross keys and Sirhowy. It gives a number of worthwhile sport routes, with a few trad routes thrown in for good measure on a series of arete, towers and corners. It is an ideal winter venue due to its south-facing nature.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>From junction 28 of the M4, follow the A467 to where it veers off left into Sirhowy Country Park.

Walk up Tribute Street for 200 yards and take a path on the left into a rack which leads right past some garages. Follow this track steeply and direct into the quarry.</p>
