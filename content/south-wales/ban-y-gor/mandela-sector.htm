            <p>The central meeting point here is usually under Nelson himself (Winnie won&rsquo;t complain anymore). </p>

            <p><b>Day Break (4) </b>obvious chimney line</p>
            <p><b>1. Morning Winpenny (5) </b>at last a pleasant warm up just left of a prominent crack.</p>
            <p><b>2. Duhka (6c)</b> * a faint groove, overlap and technical move. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>3. Blabba Mouth (7a) *</b> slightly squeezed onto vague arete. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>4. East of Sweden (6c) **</b> pleasant wall and shallow scoop with a little air between the BRs. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>5. Nelson Mandela (7b) **</b> classic. Powerful but innocuous start followed by awkward moves on the upper arete. Has lost crucial undercut hold since first ascent. <span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p><b>6. Sperm Wales (6c+)</b> desperate start to humpbacked Overlap. Gain it from left at 6b. <span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p><b>7. Spunk Trumpets (6c)</b> * pleasant via vague white tower. <span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p><b>8. Join the Union Jack (6b+) *</b> awkward bulge with beak and easy wall. <span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p><b>9. Ninety Nine Rabid feminists (6c+) </b> Fine climbing. Awkward start airy above with new finish. <span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p><b>10. Just Yvonne More (6c) *</b> difficult starting moves on arete lead to easier bulge and fine finale of 99 Rabid Feminists.</p>
            <p><b>11. Stars and Stripes (6c)**</b> Difficult overlap and pleasant upper groove.<span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p><b>12. Bad Man from Bodie (7a)*</b> technical and dynamic into and up the tiny groove.<span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p><b>13. Flat Baps (7b) *</b> short, sharp and nasty overlap <span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p><b>14. Lotus Wing (6b) **</b> smashing climbing via shallow groove system. <span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p><b>15. Dry Day (6c) *</b> Technical start and awkward groove. High in grade . <span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p>There are a handful of routes around to the left. <b>Laughability (6a) </b>climbs a short wall and slab; <b>You're Having a Laugh (6a) </b>is the testing little slab just left: <b>Amuse Bouche (4+) </b>is the scoop rightwards: <b>I've got a Bad, Bad Bottom (5) </b>climbs the groove above the start of AB and finishes up the headwall and <b>Double the Fun (4) </b>climbs the gully and face above just left.</p>
