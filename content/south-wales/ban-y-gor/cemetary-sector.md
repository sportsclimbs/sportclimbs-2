For variety and continuity of climbs this area has to lay claim to being the best on the whole crag. Most of the routes have some or all fixed gear with a mixture of climbing including roofs, walls, grooves and cracks. The area has a generally flat base and should become very popular for those operating in the E4 range.  

Unfortunately there is nothing to tempt the easier grade climber as the only E2 is a bit vegetated. Identifying features are a little tricky but they include a series of stepped roofs towards the right-hand side, a prominent flake crack in the bottom centre of the lower wall and an obvious groove system bounding the left-hand side of the sector.
