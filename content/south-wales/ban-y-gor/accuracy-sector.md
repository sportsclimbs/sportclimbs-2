            <p>To the left of Helter Skelter the wall is divided at half-height by a prominent ledge system. From this spring a quartet of very worthwhile sport climb a whilst to the sides lie a series of longer, more traditional routes. This section of cliff also supplies the easiest routes on the main crag. </p>

            <p><b>1. Baggy Trousers (6c+) &starf;&starf;</b> a splendid pitch up the slim pillar. Tough on the upper wall and a complicated finale. <span class="new">RECLEANED AND REBOLTED.</span></p>
            <p><b>2. The Correct Use of Soap (7a) &starf; </b> difficult move through roof above terrace, 2BRs. The lower wall is straightforward. <span class="new">RECLEANED AND Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>3. Lux (6b+) &starf; </b> pleasant though difficult past BR above the terrace. <span class="new">RECLEANED AND Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>4. Object VS 4a, 4b</b> pleasant lower wall and slabby groove. <span class="new">RECLEANED NEW BELAY ADDED</span></p>
            <p><b>5. Accuracy E3 5c, 5c &starf; </b>boldish slabby wall and (F6b) tower. <span class="new">RECLEANED AND REBOLTED.</span></p>
            <p><b>6. Another Day HVS 4b, 5a</b> slim upper groove. <span class="new">RECLEANED NEW BELAY ADDED</span></p>

            <p>A straightforward lower pitch leads to a half-height belay and the next three pitches, although they can just about be done in a single pitch.</p>

            <p><b>7. Costner&rsquo;s Last Stand (6c+) &starf;</b> short sharp shock squeezed onto vague arete. <span class="new">RECLEANED AND REBOLTED.</span></p>
            <p><b>8. Boys Don&rsquo;t Cry (6b) &starf;</b> easier via scoop and flake. <span class="new">RECLEANED AND REBOLTED.</span></p>
            <p><b>9. No Way Out (6b+) &starf;</b> three hard moves in a row. <span class="new">RECLEANED AND REBOLTED.</span></p>

            <p>The final three routes take the full height of the crag to the terrace. To descend, walk left to a large tree and abseil off:</p>

            <p><b>10. To Bee or not To Bee E1 5b</b> thin crack to ledge, overlap via groove, then leftwards across slab. <span class="new">New belay added.</span></p>
            <p><b>11. In My Hour of Need E1 5b</b> series of shallow grooves and direct up slab TR. <span class="new">New belay added and retrobolted.</span></p>
            <p><b>12. Home is Where the Heart Is VS 4c</b> the hideously vegetated groove. </p>
            <p>The face now swings down and to the left to provide the final bit of crag. </p>
