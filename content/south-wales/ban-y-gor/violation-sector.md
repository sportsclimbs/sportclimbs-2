This is by the far the most popular section of crag on the Escarpment and although the routes are relatively short they pack a punch. There is also an excellent low level traverse from right to left along the foot of the face.

To the left lies an area of slabs and grooves, the home to a number of excellent routes in the lower grades. These routes will doubtless become popular in the not too distant future though in general they carry little if any fixed gear. Their varied lineage may also prove a little confusing on first acquaintance but close scrutiny of the diagram (see Genetics Sector) in conjunction with the route descriptions will make things a little less confusing.
