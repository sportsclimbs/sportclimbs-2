            <p>An impressive buttress standing out from the rest of the cliff. Crossing relies on a little care but is relatively straightforward.</p>

            <p><b>In Dung E2 5b </b>shallow groove, overhang and corner right of Latest Craze.</p>
            <p><b>1. Latest Craze (7b+) **</b> barn-door arete with technical moves. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>2. Good Jab&rsquo; (7a+) * </b> technical moves right under the roof to exposed finish. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>3. Lounge Lizard Leisure Suit (6c+) *</b> varied climbing centred on the main feature of the front face. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>4. Just Too Hot (7b) **</b> superb open face climbing, fingery and technical - bolt belay on the ledge below. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>5. Time Was Once on my Side (7c) *</b> front face of buttress with desperate and height-dependant finale. </p>
            <p><b>6. Too Hot to Touch (7b) ***</b> best route on the Escarpment based around the left arete. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>7. B&rsquo;stard (7a+)*</b> tries to climb the right wall of the corner. Easier if holds used in groove to left (6c+) <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>8. The Forest (7b) </b> right-hand line through the desperate roof stack. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p>9<b>. Really Big Sur (7c) **</b> central and hardest line. Desperate. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>10. Frisco Disco (7a+) *</b> easier left-hand line but still packs a punch. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>11. Trishna E1 5b</b> the shallow groove above the doctored tree </p>
            <p><b>12 Craters of Mono (7a) * </b>technical start with trickier moves above. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>13. Breast Stroke in a D Cup (7a+) *</b> desperate struggle around right end of roof. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>14. The Gnarliest (7b+) </b> Even harder round the centre of the roof. Aptly named. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>15. Snaffel Attack (7b) * </b>the narrows but the holds run out. Thin fingers an asset. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>16 Damn Snaffelhounds E4 6a</b> bolder and harder than it looks via vague crack system. </p>
            <p><b>Rooney's Foot E5 6a </b>the dynamic left arete of Crawl Wall.</p>
            <p><b>Dear Prudence (6b) </b>short wall and blunbt arete with two big pulls.</p>
            <p><b>17. Jurisprudence E2 5b</b> pleasant little arete on left (not on topo) </p>
