## Access and Ownership

Ban-y-Gor rocks and woods are owned by the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust and form part of the Lancaut Nature Reserve, which also includes most of Wintour's Leap; consequently they are covered by the same SSSI. A further vital consideration is the proximity of the houses to the top of the crag; indeed those above the Upper Tier of The Main Cliff have gardens which extend to the very edge of the cliff. As a result, initial development of The Main Cliff was voluntarily restricted to its lower tiers to avoid any unnecessary risk of confrontation and this is now mandatory under the new access consent. In particular do not trespass on the private crag-top path north of Developer's Gully.

## Approach

From the east (Bristol, London) or the west (Cardiff) follow the M4 to the Chepstow junction and turn off here. Follow the A48 through Chepstow, over the river Wye towards Lydney. 2KM after crossing the river bridge turn left to reach Tutshill and just after the petrol station turn right. Follow this road through the village of Woodcroft (A4228) and after passing the top of Wintourâ€™s Leap and a sharp right-hand bend take a left back on yourself - Lancaut Road. Park on the grassy area on the left just after the houses.

From the parking place walk down the road to the first gate on your right - this is opposite to the descent path to Wintour's Leap. Just a little further on a path skirts off from the road and skits along the outside of the perimeter fence - please do not enter the field behind it. Follow this path around the outside of the fence almost to the far corner opposite, where a few boulders are encountered. Here a short easy descent leads to a path that contour's under the cliff and passes under the first buttresses (Mushroom Buttress) before landing you beneath Nine Lives Buttress just beyond a prominent gully.

**On no account should the field above the cliff be used to gain the same point on this descent. Nor should is be used for camping.**
