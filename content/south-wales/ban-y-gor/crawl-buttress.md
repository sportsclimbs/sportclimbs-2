An impressive buttress standing out from the rest of the cliff. Crossing relies on a little care but is relatively straightforward.

Technical moves right under the roof to exposed finish.
{.rebolted}

Varied climbing centred on the main feature of the front face.
{.rebolted}

Superb open face climbing, fingery and technical - bolt belay on the ledge below.
{.rebolted}

**5. Time Was Once on my Side (7c) *★***    
Front face of buttress with desperate and height-dependant finale.

**6. Too Hot to Touch (7b) *★★★***    
Best route on the Escarpment based around the left arête.
{.rebolted}

**7. B’stard (7a+) *★***    
Tries to climb the right wall of the corner. Easier if holds used in groove to left (6c+)

Right-hand line through the desperate roof stack.
{.rebolted}

**9. Really Big Sur (7c) *★★***    
Central and hardest line. Desperate.

Easier left-hand line but still packs a punch.
{.rebolted}

Desperate struggle around right end of roof.

**14. The Gnarliest (7b+)**  
Even harder round the centre of the roof. Aptly named.
{.rebolted}

**15. Snaffel Attack (7b) *★***    
The narrows but the holds run out. Thin fingers an asset.
{.rebolted}

**16 Damn Snaffelhounds E4 6a**    
Bolder and harder than it looks via vague crack system.

**Rooney's Foot E5 6a**    
The dynamic left arête of Crawl Wall.

**Dear Prudence (6b)**    
Short wall and blunbt arête with two big pulls.

Pleasant little arête on left (not on topo)
