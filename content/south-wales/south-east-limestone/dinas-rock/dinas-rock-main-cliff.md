**1\. Spore Wars (8a) *★★★***  
Brilliant, sustained climbing in two parts. BA to surmount roof at 7c or free at the above. Good rest at half-height.

**H1N1 8a *★***  
Climbs Bloody Spore Climbers over roof and then direct up overhanging wall to right edge of slab, from jug on slab move right into *Subversive Body Pumping* to finish.

**2\. Subversive Body Pumping (7b+) *★★***  
Hideous entry into groove, English 6c - leads to a superb crack and an airy rightwards exit.

**3\. Powers That Be (7c) *★★***  
Rightwards line from just above crux of Subversive into Berlin, then onto Still Life for its finish.

**4\. Dinasty (8a) *★★★***  
Pulls through the desperate lower overhangs to a respite on the slab with an impressive finish up the leaning wall above.

**5\. Berlin (7a+) *★★★***  
A modern classic with sustained technical interest throughout. Bouldery at the start. It is possible to take the right-hand finish from the top BR and finish over the overlaps on the right as for *Still Life*/*Powers That Be* at 7b.

**3\. Hayabusa 7c+ *★★***  
Once on the slab above the first overlap on *Berlin*, head up and left crossing *Powers That Be* to finish via the upper part of Dinasty.

**6\. Still Life (7b+) *★★★***  
Technical wizardry throughout. Move right out of *Berlin* to gain the left-hand side of the obvious arête. The bulge above gives a fitting climax.

**7\. Angel Heart E6 6c *★***  
The original way onto the arête had an aid point but has since been freed. Desperate and very sporting, hence grade.

**8\. Outta Time(7c+) *★★***  
Gain the face as for Chives but climb the left arête of the *Big Time* groove to join *Chives* for the finale. Eliminatish but good.

**9\. Big Time E6 6c *★★***  
The long slim corner with a desperate entry. The groove is bold (RPs) and the direct finish over the roof is entertaining to say the least.

**10\. Crock of Gold 7c+ *★★★***  
A pumpy/dynamic roof is combined with a hideously thin slab - get those very sticky boots out or peddle for Wales.

**11\. The Sharp Cereal Professor (7b) *★★★***  
A recently concocted series of problems incorporating Salem's Lot. A powerful and dynamic roof is coupled with a superb and intricate face above. Take care with rope drag.

**12\. Muchas Maracas (7c) *★★***  
From below the second roof on Sharp Cereal professor, undercut out right across *Harlem* to join *Hawaiian Chance* and pull the overhang to a new belay.

**13\. Harlem (7b+) *★★★***  
A magnificent varied route with all the hallmarks of a great climb: power, a sustained nature and technicalities.

**14\. Hawaiian Chance (7b+) *★★***  
A direct eliminate via *Spain*. A strenuous roof and desperate move left out of *Spain*. The bolt does not affect *Spain* despite misguided comments from some.

**15\. Spain E4 6a *★★★***  
A traditional hard classic twixt grooves, overlaps and slabs. Plenty of technical moves, a thuggish pull and numerous TRs for good measure.

**16\. Groovy Tube Day E2 5c *★★★***  
Another classic branching off right from Spain into the tube. Quite strenuous low down and technical to gain the tube. Abseil off from TB above.

**17\. Dr Van Steiner 7a+**  
A worthwhile selection of problems with a few rubbish holds thrown in for good measure. Spooky.

**18\. Venice 7a**  
A short thuggy roof. Not yet bolted.
