            <p><b>1. Spore Wars (8a) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> Brilliant, sustained climbing in two parts. BA to surmount roof at 7c or free at the above. Good rest at half-height.</p>
            <p><b>H1N1 8a &starf;</b> Climbs Bloody Spore Climbers over roof and then direct up overhanging wall to right edge of slab, from jug on slab move right into Subversive Body pumping to finish.</p>
            <p><b>2. Subversive Body Pumping (7b+) &starf;&starf;</b> Hideous entry into groove, English 6c - leads to a superb crack and an airy rightwards exit. </p>
            <p><b>3. Powers That Be (7c) &starf;&starf;</b> Rightwards line from just above crux of Subversive into Berlin, then onto Still Life for its finish.</p>
            <p><b>4. Dinasty (8a) &starf;&starf;&starf; </b>pulls the desperate lower overhangs to a respite on the slab with an impressive finale up the leaning wall above'</p>
            <p><b>5. Berlin (7a+) &starf;&starf;&starf; </b>A modern classic with sustained technical interest throughout. Bouldery at the start. It is possible to take the right-hand finish from the top BR and finish over the overlaps on the right as for Still Life/Powers that Be at 7b. </p>
            <p><b>3. Hayabusa 7c+ &starf;&starf; </b>Once on the slab above the first overlap on Berlin, head up and left crossing Powers that be to finish via the upper part of Dinasty.</p>
            <p><b>6. Still Life (7b+) &starf;&starf;&starf; </b>Technical wizardry throughout. Move right out of Berlin to gain the left-hand side of the obvious arete. The bulge above gives a fitting climax.</p>
            <p><b>7. Angel Heart E6 6c &starf;</b> The original way onto the arete had an aid point but has since been freed. Desperate and very sporting, hence grade.</p>
            <p><b>8. Outta Time</b> <b>(7c+) &starf;&starf; </b>gains the face as for Chives but climbs the left arete of the Big Time Groove to join Chives for the finale. Eliminatish but good.</p>
            <p><b>9. Big Time E6 6c &starf;&starf;</b> The long slim corner with a desperate entry. The groove is bold (RPs) and the direct finish over the roof is entertaining to say the least.</p>
            <p><b>10. Crock of Gold 7c+ &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> A pumpy/dynamic roof is combined with a hideously thin slab - get those very sticky boots out or peddle for Wales </p>
            <p><b>11. The Sharp Cereal Professor (7b) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> A recently concocted series of problems incorporating Salem's Lot. A powerful and dynamic roof is coupled with a superb and intricate face above. Take care with rope drag. </p>
            <p><b>12. Muchas Maracas (7c) </b>&starf;&starf; from below the second roof on Sharp Cereal professor, undercuts right across Harlem to join Hawaiian Chance and pull the overhang to a new belay.</p>
            <p><b>13. Harlem (7b+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> A magnificent varied route with all the hallmarks of a great climb: power, a sustained nature and technicalities. </p>
            <p><b>14. Hawaiian Chance (7b+) &starf;&starf;</b> A direct eliminate via Spain. A strenuous roof and desperate move left out of Spain. The bolt does not affect Spain despite misguided comments from some. </p>
            <p><b>15. Spain E4 6a &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> A traditional hard classic twixt grooves, overlaps and slabs. Plenty of technical moves, a thuggish pull and numerous TRs for good measure.</p>
            <p><b>16. Groovy Tube Day E2 5c &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> Another classic branching off right from Spain into the tube. Quite strenuous low down and technical to gain the tube. Abseil off from TB above. </p>
            <p><b>17. Dr Van Steiner 7a+</b> A worthwhile selection of problems with a few rubbish holds thrown in for good measure. Spooky.</p>
            <p><b>18. Venice 7a</b> short thuggy roof. Not yet bolted. </p>
