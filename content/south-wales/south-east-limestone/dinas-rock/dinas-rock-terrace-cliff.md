**1\. Academy Awards (6c) *★***    
Fine face after a meaty start over the low-level roof - can be avoided from the terrace above by coming in from the right, BB. The groove above is the real crux.

**2\. Dream Academy (6c) *★★***    
A classic slab and face climb, well worth doing. Two technical cruxes, one at half-height the other right at the end of the pitch.

**3\. El Camino Del Roy (6c+) *★***    
Another very worthwhile pitch via the obvious sharp, in more ways than one, groove. Much harder than it looks.

**4\. Danny La Rue (7a+)**    
A squeezed in pitch, not without interest. Sustained climbing, no real crux, but a few fragile holds remain.

**5\. Incidentally X (7b) *★★***    
A much changed route since the demise of a large flake. Superb climbing with a particularly trying crux rock-over. Other alternatives have yet to be found.

**6\. Tortilla Flats (7b) *★★***    
A superb addition over very unlikely terrain left of the cave. Sustained with good holds. Lower off the last BR because the finish remains fragile.

**7\. Pour Marcel (7b) *★★***    
Fine, sustained climbing right of the cave with a dynamic or powerful crux according to taste.

**8\. Brazilian Blend (6c+) *★★***    
Another excellent route, the best right of the cave. Sustained, pleasantly technical and with an airy crux.

**9\. Sverige (7a) *★***    
Slightly straightened out from the original line. Two very technical sections with a good rest in between.

**10\. Ma's Strict (7a+) *★***    
Direct line through overlaps. Surprisingly difficult. Long reaches help as do strong fingers and a sense of direction!

**11\. Breakout (6c) *★***    
A fine upper section after an easy start. The difficulties are nowhere excessive if you can pick your way amongst the ivy strands.

**12\. Vitamin Z (7a)**    
The start of Breakout takes you higher to this more technical offering. Yet to be re-re-stripped of ivy and rebolted.
