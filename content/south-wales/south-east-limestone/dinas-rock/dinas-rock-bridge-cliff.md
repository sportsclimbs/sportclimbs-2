{.topo .w100 .mt0}

**1\. Technitis (6c+)**  
Very short and very hard, 2BRs.

**2\. By Proxy (6c+)**  
Two hard moves, 2BRs.

**3\. Out Come the Freaks (7a)**  
Still a two move wonder, 2BRs.

**4\. Fings Ain't What They Used To Be (7a+) *★***  
Desperate, staggered crackline stuff with 3PRs. More than fingery!

**5\. Kennelgarth (7b) *★***  
Thin groove and blank-looking wall. Arguments about English 6a or 6b persist.

**6\. Siberian Husky (7b+) *★***  
Follow *Kennelgarth* to the triangular niche then follow a line out left to join *Fings Ain't..* and finish up that route.

**Tufa (8a+)**  
A link up from a boulder problem, *The Blessing* and finishing up *Siberian Husky*.

**7\. Eugene's High Point (7b+) Unfinished**  
An unfinished, open project that currently ends at the final staple, rather than making it all the way to the ledge. Eugene made it this far back in 1995.
