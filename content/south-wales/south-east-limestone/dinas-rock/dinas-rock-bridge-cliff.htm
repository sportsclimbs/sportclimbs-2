<p><b>1. Technitis (6c+)</b> Very short and very hard, 2BRs.</p>
<p><b>2. By Proxy (6c+)</b> Two hard moves, 2BRs.</p>
<p><b>3. Out Come the Freaks (7a)</b> Still a two move wonder, 2BRs. </p>
<p><b>4. Fings Ain't What they used to be (7a+) *</b> Desperate, staggered crackline stuff with 3PRs. More than fingery! </p>
<p><b>5. Kennelgarth (7b) *</b> Thin groove and blank-looking wall. Arguments about English 6a or 6b persist. </p>
<p><b>6. Project (open)</b></p>

<p><b>7. Project (open)</b></p>

<h2>Cave Wall</h2>

<p>Situated up and to the left of the main cave and identifiable by a very prominent cave, this wall, after recent cleaning activities, now offers ten very worthwhile pitches.</p>

<p><b>1. Pis En Lit (6b+) *</b> pleasant climbing up the left-hand side of the arete. Hard start. </p>
<p><b>2. Illegal Congress (6b)</b> left-hand side of the front face via a small groove.</p>
<p><b>3. Family Values (6b)</b> Right-hand side of front face. Pleasant climbing.</p>
<p><b>4. Stray Cats (7a) *</b> Excellent route on compact rock. Hard start, then technical. </p>
<p><b>5. Puss Off (7a) *</b> Superb juggy roof with a fine technical upper groove/ramp. </p>
<p><b>6. Each Way Nudger (6b+) *</b> Pleasant climbing with a steep bulging finish. </p>
<p><b>7. When Push Comes to Shove (7a) *</b> open wall climbing with a steep and technical finish</p>
<p><b>8. Call a Spade a Spade (6c) *</b> Another good wall climb. Hard through the overhang.</p>
<p><b>9. Totally Radish (6b+) *</b> Excellent exposed arete with thuggy roof start. </p>
<p><b>10. Durbin Two, Watson Nil (7c) *</b> Desperate roof problem and easier shallow groove. </p>
