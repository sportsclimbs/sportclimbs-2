            <p><b>1. Academy Awards (6c) *</b> fine face after a meaty start over the low-level roof - can be avoided from the terrace above by coming in from the right, BB. The groove above is the real crux.</p>
            <p><b>2. Dream Academy (6c) **</b> a classic slab and face climb, well worth doing. Two technical cruxes, one at half-height the other right at the end of the pitch. </p>
            <p><b>3. El Camino Del Roy (6c+) *</b> another very worthwhile pitch via the obvious sharp, in more ways than one, groove. Much harder than it looks. </p>
            <p><b>4. Danny La Rue (7a+)</b> a squeezed in pitch, not without interest. Sustained climbing, no real crux, but a few fragile holds remain. </p>
            <p><b>5. Incidentally X (7b) **</b> a much changed route since the demise of a large flake. Superb climbing with a particularly trying crux rock-over. Other alternatives have yet to be found. </p>
            <p><b>6. Tortilla Flats (7b) **</b> a superb addition over very unlikely terrain left of the cave. Sustained with good holds. Lower off the last BR because the finish remains fragile.</p>
            <p><b>7. Pour Marcel (7b) **</b> fine, sustained climbing right of the cave with a dynamic or powerful crux according to taste. </p>
            <p><b>8. Brazilian Blend (6c+) **</b> another excellent route, the best right of the cave. Sustained, pleasantly technical and with an airy crux. </p>
            <p><b>9. Sverige (7a) *</b> slightly straightened out from the original line. Two very technical sections with a good rest in between.</p>
            <p><b>10. Ma's Strict (7a+) *</b> direct line through overlaps. Surprisingly difficult. Long reaches help as do strong fingers and a sense of direction! </p>
            <p><b>11. Breakout (6c) *</b> a fine upper section after an easy start. The difficulties are nowhere excessive if you can pick your way amongst the ivy strands. </p>
            <p><b>12. Vitamin Z (7a)</b> the start of Breakout takes you higher to this more technical offering. Yet to be re-re-stripped of ivy and rebolted. </p>
