            <p>A superb wall, overhanging in its left half with sustained routes to match, and easier angled to the right with some delicate face routes.</p>

            <p><b>1. Liassic Lark (6c+) *</b> jamming crack with a tough bulge. Can be greasy early in season.</p>
            <p><b>2. In Search of Bedrock (7a) *</b> natural continuation via groove system. Sustained.</p>
            <p><b>3. Help, Help Me Rhondda (7c) *</b> desperate, fingery sequence though short. </p>
            <p><b>4. Project </b></p>
            <p><b>5. This God is Mine (7b+) ***</b> classic. Sustained and fingery via the obvious thin crackline.</p>
            <p><b>6. Masada (8a) ***</b> desperate face route, hardest in area. </p>
            <p><b>7. Stone Wings E5 6a **</b> superb, traditional crack climb. </p>
            <p> <b>8. The Uninvited Guest (7b) **</b> short but very technical sequence to gain groove. Friend 3 needed.</p>
            <p><b>9. Staple Diet (7b) ***</b> superb overhanging groove and crack. Sustained, not over-technical. A big pump. </p>
            <p><b>10. Tragic Moustache (7a) *</b> hard start and finish. Fine face in between. </p>
            <p><b>11. Five O'Clock Shadow (6c+) **</b> superb face climbing. Very technical in middle. </p>
            <p><b>12. Pelagic Mush (6a+)</b> easiest route on crag so far. Pleasantly sustained. Not: not marked on diagram. </p>
            <p><b>13. Sideburn (6b)</b> short hard section, easier with long reach. Note: not marked on diagram.</p>
            <p><b>14. Magic Touch (6b) *</b> excellent diagonal face climb. Not originally bolted! </p>
            <p><b>15. Spear the Bearded Clam (6b)</b> new right-hand route since disappearance of block. Not on diagram. </p>
