## Introduction

This fine crag, composed of the highest quality limestone, is situated above a magnificent beach on the western side of Dunraven Bay, Southerndown, near to Ogmore-by-Sea. It offers excellent sport climbing through a range of grades on vertical to overhanging rock. The crag faces north-west, getting the sun in late afternoon onwards during the summer months. In the winter months it gets no sun and suffers from large amounts of seepage. However the rest of the year the crag dries out quickly after rainfall.

## Access

There are no access issues at present. However note this is a busy, family beach. Please respect this by avoiding foul language and any antisocial behaviour. Also note that dogs are not allowed on the beach during the Summer months.

## Approach

From Bridgend, take the B4265 southwards to St. Brides Major. Turn right at the Post Office and follow the B4524 to Southerndown. Turn left by the Three Golden Cups pub and follow the road down a steep hill to a car park. A small charge is usually required. The cliff is situated on the left-hand side of the beach on an obvious promontory.

The crag is partially tidal though most of the routes are accessible at high tide. You can walk across the beach to reach the crag except for around 1.5 hours either side of high tide. At such times you can approach from above: follow the track up the hillside and identify a small track right of a small bramble bush above the crag. This leads down to a small high level crag (Tufa Terrace) below which is an abseil ring. Descent from this gains the crag.
