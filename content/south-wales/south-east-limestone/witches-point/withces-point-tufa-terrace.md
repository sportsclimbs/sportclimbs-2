**1. Project**

**2. Project**

**3. Tufa Joy (7a)**  
A little dusty. Hard start and powerful finish rightwards.

**4. Tufa at the Top (7a) *★★***  
A gem of a route taking the 'sexual' Tufa. Harder than it looks.

**5. It's Tufa at the Bottom (7a+) *★***  
Appropriately named. Fingery, powerful and sustained.

**6. Tufa Tennis E3 5c (6b+) *★***  
A pleasant companion route, again deceiving.
