A superb wall, overhanging in its left half with sustained routes to match, and easier angled to the right with some delicate face routes.

**1. Crime Slunk Scene (7b) *★★***  
Hard climbing through the roof crack succombs to a mix kneebars, toehooks and thuggery.


**2. Liassic Lark (6c+) *★***  
A jamming crack with a tough bulge. Can be greasy early in season.

**3. In Search of Bedrock (7a) *★***  
The natural continuation via groove system. Sustained.

**4. Help, Help Me Rhondda (7c) *★***  
A desperate, fingery sequence though short.

**Wilma!!!! Help Me Look For My Bedsocks (7c) *★***  
A link up of *Help, Help Me Rhondda* and *In Search of Bedrock* crossing *Liassic Lark* after *Rhondda's* main bulge.

**5. The Dai Vinci Coed (7c) *★★***  
Climb up *Rhondda* to a jug, move right

**6. Methuselah (8a) *★★★***  
A link up of *Dai Vinci* into *Masada* with a short but good bit of independent climbing. Start up *Dai Vinci Coed*. Move right into *This God..* and follow a sloper rail into *Masada*.

**7. This God is Mine (7b+) *★★★***  
Classic. Sustained and fingery via the obvious thin crackline.

**8. Masada (8a+) *★★★***  
A desperate face route, the hardest in the area. The line goes directly up to the overlap without using the crack. 

**9. Stone Wings (E5 6a) *★★***  
The obvious jamming crack that splits the crag gives superb, traditional climbing.

**10. The Uninvited Guest (7b) *★★***  
A short but very technical sequence to gain a groove. A friend 3 is needed for the crack.

**11. Mr. T (8a+) *★★***  
Follow a thin seam across *Stone Wings* and into *Masada* at two jugs. Move left and up, across *This God..* to the pod on *Dai Vinci* and finish up that route.

**12. Super Size Me (7c+) *★★***  
Follow *Staple Diet* past its big flake then move left on good crimps into a groove. A rock up, more crimps and a hard-to-read section lead to the ledge.

**13. Staple Diet (7b) *★★★***  
A superb overhanging groove and crack. Sustained, not over-technical but a big pump.

**14. Tragic Moustache (7a)  *★★***  
A hard start and finish with a fine face in between.

**15. Five O'Clock Shadow (6c+) *★★***  
Superb face climbing. Very technical in middle. Climb up to a large flake and ramp, up the wall to finish over the roof above. The right-hand start provides an easier alternative: **Dolphin Shadow (6c) ★**.

**16. Magic Touch (6b) *★***  
An excellent diagonal face climb.

**17. Pelagic Mush (6a+) *★***  
A pleasantly sustained easier route. The left-hand start is is **Dolphin Gas (6b) ★**.

**18. Sideburn (6b)**  
A short hard section that's easier with a long reach.

**19. Spear the Bearded Clam (6b)**  
The hardest part is in the lower half.

**20. Slurp the Savoury Oyster (5+)**  
The furthest right and easiest line on the cliff.
