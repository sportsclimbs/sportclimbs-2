## Introduction

This fine crag, composed of the highest quality limestone, is situated above a magnificent beach on the western side of Dunraven Bay, Southerndown, near to Ogmore-by-Sea. It offers excellent sport climbing on vertical to overhanging rock with a range of grades from 3+ to 8a+. 
The cliff is easily accessed and has the advantage of being situated on a ‘blue flag’ beach.


Martin Crocker rediscovered the crag in 1986 adding several new routes. It was subsequently developed in the early Nineties as a sport crag by Roy Thomas and Gary Gibson, with the odd gem from Crocker and Eugene Jones. This magnificent little cliff is South Wales’ answer to Lower Pen Trwyn. 

The climbing generally features steep or overhanging walls with edges, tufas and pockets with the occasional large roof thrown in. All the climbing is sustained and wonderful.

## Conditions

The crag faces north-west, getting the sun in late afternoon from May onwards. From then on it dries quickly after rainfall, though can get damp in very humid weather. In the winter months it gets no sun and suffers from large amounts of seepage. 

## Access

There are no access issues at present. However note this is a busy, family beach. Please respect this by avoiding foul language and any antisocial behaviour. Also note that dogs are not allowed on the beach during the Summer months.

## Approach

From Bridgend, take the B4265 southwards to St. Brides Major. Turn right at the Post Office and follow the B4524 to Southerndown. Turn left by the Three Golden Cups pub and follow the road down a steep hill to a car park. A small charge is usually required. The cliff is situated on the left-hand side of the beach on an obvious promontory.

The crag is partially tidal although most of the routes are accessible at high tide. You can walk across the beach to reach the crag except for around 1.5 hours either side of high tide. At such times you can approach from above: follow the track up the hillside and identify a small track right of a small bramble bush above the crag. This leads down to a small high level crag (Tufa Terrace) below which is an abseil ring. Descent from this gains the crag.

There are several sections of cliff with an excellent variety of routes:

**Stone Wings Cliff**: The thin crackline of _This God is Mine_ (7b+ ★★★), the very overhanging jam crack of _Stone Wings_ (E5 6a ★★). Just right is one of South East Wales’ hardest routes, _Masada_ (8a ★★★). The overhanging ramp of _Staple Diet_ (7b ★★) and to the right a number of fine, easier grade wall pitches including _Five O’clock Shadow_ (6c ★★).

**Tufa Terrace:** The tufas of _Tufa at the Top_ (7a ★) and _It’s Tufa at the Bottom_ (7a+ ★).

**Dunraven Cliff:** The scoop and groove of the _World-Vs-Gibson_ (7a ★★), the excellent wall and arête of _Leave it to the Dogs_ (7a+ ★★★). The superb hanging wall of _Hanging by a Thread_ (6c ★★★), the best route of its grade in the area. The fingery bulge of _Edge-Hog_ (7b+ ★★) and the magnificent, though mixed route of _Grow-Up_ (7b+ ★★).

**The Gantry** on the right-hand side of the cliff provides a quartet of grade 6b/c climbs in a fine position with the showstopper *The Overlook* (7b+ ★).

**Witches Cave** The superb roof route *Evil K'nee Full* is one of the best 7a+s.  -->
