            <p><b>1. Project</b>2. Project</p>
            <p><b>3. Tufa Joy (7a)</b> a little dusty. Hard start and powerful finish rightwards.</p>
            <p><b>4. Tufa at the Top (7a) **</b> a gem of a route taking the 'sexual' Tufa. Harder than it looks. </p>
            <p><b>5. It's Tufa at the Bottom (7a+) *</b>appropriately named. Fingery, powerful and sustained. </p>
            <p><b>6. Tufa Tennis E3 5c (6b+) * </b> A pleasant companion route, again deceiving.</p>
