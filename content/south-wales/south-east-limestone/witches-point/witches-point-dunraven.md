A long section of cliff seemed with grooves and overhangs. The variety of climbing here is extensive. The central section of cliff can suffer from seepage into mid June.

The first 5 routes start from a grassy ledge known as Tufa Terrace. This is gained either by scrambling down a grassy scoop by a gorse bush from the top or scramblikng up the ramp between Stone Wings Cliff and Dunraven Cliff. There's also the approach route *PCB*.

A little dusty. A hard start leads ot a powerful finish going rightwards.

A gem of a route taking the 'sexual' Tufa. Harder than it looks.

A superb arête and powerful bulge. Harder for short. Fine positions.

**16. Grow-Up! (7b+) *★★***

An easy access pitch up the slabs to The Gantry.

**18. Young, Gifted and Beige (4)**  
The right-hand easy access pitch to The Gantry.

## The Gantry

{.topo .w100}

The Gantry is the area over to the right bounded by a big roof on it's left-hand side. Approach from the top of the crag and walk down. You can also use either of the previous access pitches if coming from below. It catches the afternoon sun and is rarely greasy. It's also the best spot to climb here during the winter too.
