A long section of cliff seemed with grooves and overhangs. The variety of climbing here is extensive. The central section of cliff can suffer from seepage into mid June.

The first 5 routes start from a grassy ledge known as Tufa Terrace. This is gained either by scrambling down a grassy scoop by a gorse bush from the top or scramblikng up the ramp between Stone Wings Cliff and Dunraven Cliff. There's also the approach route *PCB*.

**1. Tufa King Hard (6c+)**  
What was an alternative start to *Tufa Joy* now has its own finish and belay.

**2. Tufa Joy (7a)**  
A little dusty. A hard start leads ot a powerful finish going rightwards.

**3. Tufa at the Top (7a) *★★***  
A gem of a route taking the 'sexual' Tufa. Harder than it looks.

**4. It's Tufa at the Bottom (7a+) *★***  
Appropriately named. Fingery, powerful and sustained.

Hard and reachy at the crux. Packs a punch.

**11. There's Life in the Old Dog Yet (6c+) *★★***  
Features a short, sharp crux in fine position.

Climbs the centre of wall via prominent flake. Long reach/desperate crux.

**13. Hanging by a Thread (6c) *★★★***

**14. Edgemoor (7b+) *★***  
Short, hard and fingery crux with a bolt-on hold.

**15. Edge-Hog (7b+) *★★★***  
A superb arête and powerful bulge. Harder for short. Fine positions.

**16. Grow-Up! (7b+) *★★***  
A mega route through centre of bulges and roofs. Complicated lineage.

**17. Pasty = Man Boobs (4)**  
An easy access pitch up the slabs to The Gantry.

**18. Young, Gifted and Beige (4)**  
The right-hand easy access pitch to The Gantry.

## The Gantry 

![The Gantry topo](/img/south-wales/south-east-limestone/WITGAL.gif)
{.topo .w100}

The Gantry is the area over to the right bounded by a big roof on it's left-hand side. Approach from the top of the crag and walk down. You can also use either of the previous access pitches if coming from below. It catches the afternoon sun and is rarely greasy. It's also the best spot to climb here during the winter too.

**4. Broken on the Rocks (6b)**  
A short pleasant wall.

**5. Marooned (6a+)**
