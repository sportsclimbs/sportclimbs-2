**1. Fatman And Nob In (3+)**  
Climb the wall right of the corner without using the corner.

**2. Gay Batman (5)**  
The second line of bolts up the steep wall to the same belay as *Fatman*.

**3. Robin's Yoghurt Supper (5) *&starf;***  
Climbs the wall left of the stepped corner to the belay of the next route.

**4. Abra-Ker-Fucking-Dabra (5+) *&starf;&starf;***  
The corner moving right below the final roof.

**5. Sorcerer's Assistant (6a+)**  
Climb over the nose through the roofs just right of the corner.

**6. Magic Circle (6a+)**  
Climb the roofs right again. Can be slippery in high humidity.

**7. Smoke and Mirrors (6b) *&starf;&starf;***  
Good steep climbing moving left around the hanging arÃªte.

**8. Great Expectorations (6b) *&starf;&starf;***  
Climb through several roofs 3m right of *Smoke and Mirrors* finishing up a groove.

**9. Phlegmatic Solution (6c)**  
More roof climbing leads into a groove. Swing out right from this and up the tricky headwall.

<!-- **Pthegthorga Phlem (E2 5a)**  
Just left of Evil Ways, Bridgend Steve's route up the chossy groove. Loose. Are you sold on this one? 12m -->


**10. Evil Ways (7b) *&starf;***  
A technical roof climb through the left side of the main roof and up the 'slightly slabby' wall above.

**11. Evil K'nee Full (7a+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
The roof right again is breached via a prominent jug on the lip. Possible rests include a kneebar and a head jam. Finish through the v-groove in the upper roof. An awesome route that's high in the grade.

**Project 1**  
The middle of the roof is still unclimbed, marked by a line of staples.

**Project 2**  
A line of bolt studs and pegs at the right end of the roof mark another unclimbed line.

**12. White Witch (E5 6b)**  
A trad extension to the next route completing the full traverse above the cave and finishing up *Evil K'nee Full*. The original pegs protecting the route have corroded away.

**13. Willie the Pimp (6c+) *&starf;&starf;***  
Start beneath a corner to the right of the main roof. A hard start leads to a crack leading leftwards to above the roof. Traverse left, up to a niche and continue leftwards to a belay below the upper roof.

**14. Thin Lizzy (6c+) *&starf;&starf;***  
Follow the previous route but head up towards the hanging groove that breaches the upper roofs. Finish up this taking care with the rock.


**15. Wrasse Wipe (6c)**  
Follow the previous *Thin Lizzie* but climb up the groove. So named because, 'its often got a damp bottom'.

**16. Wrasse-putins Hypodermic Typewriter (6b+)**  
Climb through the lower overhang on very sharp, spikey, wave washed holds and continue up to the same lower off as *Wrasse Wipe*.

**17. Didymo Clogs Your Tackle (6b)**  
More sharpness and a long reach are required to reach the first good hold.

**18. Fishermen Pump Their Rods (6a+)**  
More of the same.

**19. Wrasse Bandit (6b+)**  
More spiky climbing through the lower bulges.

**20. Sore Wrasse (6c)**  
Or, more likely, sore fingers. Harder climbing on similarly sharp holds.

**21. Wrassetafarian (6b+) *&starf;***  
The next line is easier than it looks.

**22. Little Wrasse Cull (6a)**  
The final route on the undercut, spikey wall has a hard start up past a thread.

**The Bedraggled Trousered Misogynist (5+)**  
Not marked on the topo but this is located about 10 metres right of the previous route, starting above the lowest of the weed covered steps.
