{.topo}

A superb wall, overhanging in its left half with sustained routes to match, and easier angled to the right with some delicate face routes.

**1. Liassic Lark (6c+) *★***  
A jamming crack with a tough bulge. Can be greasy early in season.
{.mt0}

**2. In Search of Bedrock (7a) *★***  
The natural continuation via groove system. Sustained.

**3. Help, Help Me Rhondda (7c) *★***  
A desperate, fingery sequence though short.

**4. Project**

**5. This God is Mine (7b+) *★★★***  
Classic. Sustained and fingery via the obvious thin crackline.

**6. Masada (8a) *★★★***  
A desperate face route, the hardest in the area.

**7. Stone Wings E5 6a *★★***  
A superb, traditional crack climb.

**8. The Uninvited Guest (7b) *★★***  
A short but very technical sequence to gain a groove. Friend 3 needed.

**9. Staple Diet (7b) *★★★***  
A superb overhanging groove and crack. Sustained, not over-technical but a big pump.

**10. Tragic Moustache (7a) *★***  
A hard start and finish. Fine face in between.

**11. Five O'Clock Shadow (6c+) *★★***  
Superb face climbing. Very technical in middle.

**12. Pelagic Mush (6a+)**  
The easiest route on crag so far. Pleasantly sustained. NB. not marked on diagram.

**13. Sideburn (6b)**  
A short hard section that's easier with a long reach. NB. not marked on diagram.

**14. Magic Touch (6b) *★***  
An excellent diagonal face climb. Not originally bolted!

**15. Spear the Bearded Clam (6b)**  
A new right-hand route since disappearance of block. NB not marked on diagram.
