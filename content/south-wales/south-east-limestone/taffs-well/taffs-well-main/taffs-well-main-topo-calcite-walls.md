**2. Organised Chaos (6c) *★***  
The centre of the wall is well worth the effort. Sustained.

**3. The Melty Man Cometh (7a)**  
The right-hand side of the wall with three hard sections. All on good rock.

**4. Ye Old Campaigner E5 6b**  
the left-hand line via a rib and to move leftwards to a superb and very steep finale.

**5. LA Confidential (7a) *★★***  
Continues straight up to the left-hand end of the overlap and plows on direct via superb sustained moves.

**6. Crow Man E6 6a *★★***  
a plum central pitchup the centre of the huge wall to the left. Sustained, 70m rope.

**7. Kings of New York (7a+) *★★★***  
branches right out of Spirit to climb a tricky flowstone rib and superb sustained headwall. Low in grade.

**8. The Connecticut Connection (7a+) *★★★***  
super long pitch to right starting from 'pit' and culminating in a brilliant and intricate headwall. 16 clips.

**9. Minnesota Nice (7a+) *★★★***  
a magnificent route taking the left edge of the wall on positive holds after a technical start. The finish gives brilliant climbing on grey flowstone. Top bolts now removed.

**10. Melting Man (7a) *★★***  
the centre of the face. Another fine sustained exercise.

**11. Ghengis Khan (6c) *★★***  
superb sustained face climbing after a tricky bulge at the start.

pleasant face climbing with a tricky bulge and following the faint rib above.

**13. Bulbus Tara (4)**  
faint groove line above prominent tree stump.

**14. Hirsuit Ulvula (6a)**  
short tricky arête and easy groove above. The next group of routes begin from a grassy platform at 10m, gained by a fixed rope.
