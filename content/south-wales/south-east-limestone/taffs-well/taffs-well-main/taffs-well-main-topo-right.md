**1\. Mega Mix (5)**  
Pleasant slab to tricky bulge and exit.

**2\. Gwest y Gymru 7 Inch Mix (6b) *★***  
Pleasant grey rib with slopers and awkward holds. Worthwhile.

**3\. The Twelve Inch Version! (7a)**  
Short problem type route with slopers and edges.

**4\. Daggers (6c) *★★***  
Excellent intricate face route with hidden holds and pleasant moves.

**5\. Look Over Yonder (7a) *★★***  
Similar to its neighbour but a notch higher in difficulty.

**6\. Wet Afternoon (7b+) *★★***  
Very technical face climbing with unusual moves and a scary fourthclip. A 'sprag' provides the key.

**7\. Name Unknown (6b)**  
Open groove gained via lower wall. Unusual. Needs traffic.

Long route (70m rope) via obvious 'hollowed scoop' short steep wall and fine technical headwall right of Rancho La Cha Cha Cha.

Very pleasant climbing with easy start and left-hand side of barrel-shaped rib.

**10\. Good Gear, Good Cheer (6b) *★***  
Pleasant blunt rib with one difficult move, slightly harder since loss of a hold.

**11\. No Beer, No Fear (6a+) *★***  
Again enjoyable aiming for the obvious groove with a red right wall.

**12\. Not my Fault! (6c+)**  
Two boulder problem squeezed onto the wall and rib. Contrived.

**13\. Id-iot (6b) *★***  
Again excellent. A technical lower move and fine above.

**14\. CJD (6b) *★***  
Very pleasant climbing with a technical middle section.

**15\. Get Down on This (6b) *★***  
Again good. Difficult through upper overlap.

**16\. Get Thee Hence (6c+)**  
Short but super technical blunt rib.

**17\. Unnamed (6c)**  
more of the same via a faint crack.

**18\. Unnamed (6c+)**  
Final blank-looking wall.

**19\. Talk about False Gods (7b+)**  
Weetabix-like wall above.
