            <p><b>1. Mega Mix (5)</b> pleasant slab to tricky bulge and exit.</p>
            <p><b>2. Gwest y Gymru 7 Inch Mix (6b) &starf;</b> pleasant grey rib with slopers and awkward holds. Worthwhile.</p>
            <p><b>3. The Twelve Inch Version! (7a)</b> short problem type route with slopers and edges.</p>
            <p><b>4. Daggers (6c) &starf;&starf;</b> excellent intricate face route with hidden holds and pleasant moves.</p>
            <p><b>5. Look Over Yonder (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> similar to its neighbour but a notch higher in difficulty.</p>
            <p><b>6. Wet Afternoon (7b+) &starf;&starf;</b> very technical face climbing with unusual moves and a scary fourthclip. A 'sprag' provides the key.</p>
            <p><b>7. Name Unknown (6b)</b> open groove gained via lower wall. Unusual. Needs traffic.</p>
            <p><b>8. Ulrika Ka kA kA (6c+) &starf;</b> long route (70m rope) via obvious 'hollowed scoop' short steep wall and fine technical headwall right of Rancho La Cha Cha Cha.</p>
            <p><b>9. D'ya Hear Ma Dear (6a+) &starf;</b> very pleasant climbing with easy start and left-hand side of barrel-shaped rib.</p>
            <p><b>10. Good Gear, Good Cheer (6b) &starf;</b> pleasant blunt rib with one difficult move, slightly harder since loss of a hold.</p>
            <p><b>11. No Beer, No Fear (6a+) &starf;</b> again enjoyable aiming for the obvious groove with a red right wall.</p>
            <p><b>12. Not my Fault! (6c+)</b> two boulder problem squeezed onto the wall and rib. Contrived.</p>
            <p><b>13. Id-iot (6b) &starf; </b>again excellent. A technical lower move and fine above.</p>
            <p><b>14. CJD (6b) &starf;</b> very pleasant climbing with a technical middle section.</p>
            <p><b>15. Get Down on This (6b) &starf;</b> again good. Difficult through upper overlap.</p>
            <p><b>16. Get Thee Hence (6c+)</b> short but super technical blunt rib.</p>
            <p><b>17. Unnamed (6c)</b> more of the same via a faint crack.</p>
            <p><b>18. Unnamed (6c+)</b> final blank-looking wall.</p>
            <p><b>19. Talk about False Gods (7b+)</b> weetabix-like wall above.</p>
