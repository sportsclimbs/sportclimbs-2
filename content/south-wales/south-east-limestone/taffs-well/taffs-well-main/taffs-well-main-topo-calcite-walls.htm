<p>The
    first three routes start at the left-hand end of the wall and share a common start to a second ledge and belay (6b).</p>

<p><b>1. Red Square (6b+) </b>The left-hand side of the wall. Two technical sections.</p>
<p><b>2. Organised Chaos (6c) *</b> The centre of the wall is well worth the effort. Sustained.</p>
<p><b>3. The Melty Man Cometh (7a) </b>The right-hand side of the wall with three hard sections. All on good rock.</p>
<p><b>4. Ye Old Campaigner E5 6b </b>the left-hand line via a rib and to move leftwards to a superb and very steep finale.</p>
<p><b>5. LA Confidential (7a) ** </b>Continues straight up to the left-hand end of the overlap and plows on direct via superb sustained moves.</p>
<p><b>6. Crow Man E6 6a **</b> a plum central pitchup the centre of the huge wall to the left. Sustained, 70m rope.</p>
<p><b>7. Kings of New York (7a+) *** </b>branches right out of Spirit to climb a tricky flowstone rib and superb sustained headwall. Low in grade.</p>
<p><b>8. The Connecticut Connection (7a+) *** </b>super long pitch to right starting from 'pit' and culminating in a brilliant and intricate headwall. 16 clips.</p>
<p><b>9. Minnesota Nice (7a+) ***</b> a magnificent route taking the left edge of the wall on positive holds after a technical start. The finish gives brilliant climbing on grey flowstone. <span class="new">Top bolts now removed.</span></p>
<p><b>10. Melting Man (7a) **</b> the centre of the face. Another fine sustained exercise.</p>
<p><b>11. Ghengis Khan (6c) **</b> superb sustained face climbing after a tricky bulge at the start.</p>
<p><b>12. Tarus Bulba (6b+) **</b> pleasant face climbing with a tricky bulge and following the faint rib above.</p>
<p><b>13. Bulbus Tara (4)</b> faint groove line above prominent tree stump.</p>
<p><b>14. Hirsuit Ulvula (6a)</b> short tricky arete and easy groove above. The next group of routes begin from a grassy platform at 10m, gained by a fixed rope.</p>
