            <p><b>4. Jesus Wept (6c)</b> tricky start, then open slabby face with plenty of interest.</p>

            <p>Three route lie to the left of the top of this:</p>
            <p><b>Space Cowboys (6c+) *</b> left-hand line from belay gained by traverse from belay of Jesus Wept. Short hard section low down.</p>
            <p><b>Heavenly (7a) **</b> central line from belay gives superb sustained exercise.</p>

            <p><b>Celestial Being (7b) **</b> the right-hand line gives a sustained exercise with technical moves low down and fingery ones high up.</p>
            <p><b>5. Christendom (7a) *</b> long sustained and finger wall with delicate crux and easier climbing above.</p>
            <p><b>6. Angel of Mons (6c+) *</b> perhaps slightly better to the right with a low technical crux and pleasant sustained climbing above. </p>
            <p><b>7. Decimus Maximus (6b) **</b>Again very pleasant climbing taking a rib and groove followed by an intricate slab. The continuation up the headwall above the belay gives:</p>
            <p><b>Maximus Extensicus (6c) *</b> the next group of routes are situated directly above the lower walls from belays atop its left-hand routes.</p>
            <p><b>8. I'm Spartacus (7b+) *** </b>another magnificent route taking a snaking leftwards line up the black-streaked wall. Sustained and high in the grade with a frustrating finale.</p>
            <p><b>9. Sugar Bullets (7b+) ***</b> superb sustained climbing culminating in an impressively situated crux with the final moves on the headwall. May be dusty.</p>
            <p><b>10. Stray Bullet (6c+) ** </b>the direct version of Sugar Bullets gives a superb sustained exercise</p>
            <p><b>11. Scram (7b) ** </b>super-sustained face climbing with no single hard move but plenty of them.</p>
            <p><b>12. New Day Today (7a) * </b>hard move over initial bulge then pleasant, easier face.</p>
            <p><b>13. Rancho La Cha, Cha, Cha (6c+) *</b> arcing line with pleasant sustained climbing.</p>
            <p><b>14. Ulrika Ka kA kA (6c+) *</b> from lower tier onto slabby upper face.</p>
