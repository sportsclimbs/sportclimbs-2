**4\. Jesus Wept (6c)** 
Tricky start, then open slabby face with plenty of interest.

Three route lie to the left of the top of this:

**Space Cowboys (6c+) *★*** 
Left-hand line from belay gained by traverse from belay of Jesus Wept. Short hard section low down.

**Heavenly (7a) *★★*** 
Central line from belay gives superb sustained exercise.

**Celestial Being (7b) *★★*** 
The right-hand line gives a sustained exercise with technical moves low down and fingery ones high up.

**5\. Christendom (7a) *★*** 
Long sustained and finger wall with delicate crux and easier climbing above.

**6\. Angel of Mons (6c+) *★*** 
Perhaps slightly better to the right with a low technical crux and pleasant sustained climbing above.

**7\. Decimus Maximus (6b) *★★***  
Again very pleasant climbing taking a rib and groove followed by an intricate slab. The continuation up the headwall above the belay gives:

**Maximus Extensicus (6c) *★*** 
The next group of routes are situated directly above the lower walls from belays atop its left-hand routes.

**8\. I'm Spartacus (7b+) *★★★*** 
Another magnificent route taking a snaking leftwards line up the black-streaked wall. Sustained and high in the grade with a frustrating finale.

**9\. Sugar Bullets (7b+) *★★★*** 
Superb sustained climbing culminating in an impressively situated crux with the final moves on the headwall. May be dusty.

**10\. Stray Bullet (6c+) *★★*** 
The direct version of Sugar Bullets gives a superb sustained exercise

**11\. Scram (7b) *★★***  
Super-sustained face climbing with no single hard move but plenty of them.

**12\. New Day Today (7a) *★***  
A hard move over initial bulge then pleasant, easier face.

**13\. Rancho La Cha, Cha, Cha (6c+) *★*** 
Arcing line with pleasant sustained climbing.

**14\. Ulrika Ka kA kA (6c+) *★***  
From lower tier onto slabby upper face.
