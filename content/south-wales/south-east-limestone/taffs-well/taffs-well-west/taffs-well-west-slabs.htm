        <p>These are gained by continuing along the track through a muddy section. After 300 yards the slabs appear on the right.</p>

        <p><b>1. The Bony King of Nowhere (5+) </b>the leftmost route left of a clump of ivy. Poor.</p>
        <p><b>2. Once Upon a Time (6a) </b>just to the right of the ivy. Needs traffic.</p>
        <p><b>3. Can the Can (6c) </b>the first of the technical slabs moving back to finish.</p>
        <p><b>4. Palm (7a) * </b>the left-centre of the slab via a vague orange depression.</p>
        <p><b>5. Neil Kinnock's Last Stand (7a+) * </b>the most technical route up the centre of the slab.</p>
        <p><b>6. Chinese Whispers (6b+) </b>perhaps the warm up for the harder routes on the right-hand side of the slab.</p>
        <p><b>7. Glenys Encounters her First Limp Member (6a) </b>the right-hand edge of the slab. The first ascensionist is clearly in need of help!</p>
