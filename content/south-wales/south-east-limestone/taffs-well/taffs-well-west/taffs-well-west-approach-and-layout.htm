            <h3>Situation</h3>

            <p>The crag lies on the opposite of the valley to Taffs Well Main and is easily accessible from the A470 (see map). It lies tucked away in the wooded hillside and is not immediately obvious on first acquaintance.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>When approaching from Cardiff along the A470 take the exit as for Taffs Well Main to the roundabout that it overlooks. </p>

            <p>Instead of turning right towards the parking are for that crag, turn left to a second roundabout and then right. After 800m a right turn for Garth Newydd Road and park here. Cross the main road and strike directly up the hillside for 80m or so - faint paths show the way - to meet a long diagonal rake running left. Follow this for 300m to the obvious bay.</p>
