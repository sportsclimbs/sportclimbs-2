South Wall
----------

![Taffs Well West topo](/img/south-wales/south-east-limestone/Taffs-Well-West-Diamond-Wall.jpg)
{.topo}

Although short, this wall provides three difficult routes requiring an abundance of both power and finesse combined. Can be damp in humid weather.
{.csa}

**1\. Bristol Beat (7a+)**  
Short but powerful climbing in its length. Keep going rightwards to the belay.
{.mt0}

**2\. Screaming Neutrino's (7b+) *★***  
An even more powerful sequence up the shallow pumping groove. Yet to be rebolted.

**3\. It's a Black World (7a) *★***  
Finesse at last. The clean black wall provides the intricate route of the wall. Black is certainly beautiful.

**4\. Howling Hadrons (6b+) *★***  
Right-hand side of wall with technical start and juggy finale.

The Back Wall
-------------

Perhaps, in many ways, this is the centrepiece of the quarry. Unfortunately, it does suffer from a large amount of seepage in the spring months. Once dry, it provides a fine collection of pitches on generally immaculate compact rock. The type of climbing is unique to the area. All of the routes need re-bolting.
{.csa}

**1\. The Quartz Bicycle (6c+)**  
undercut flake, now gone. Needs rebolting and cleaning.
{.mt0}

**2\. You Never can Tell (7a) *★***  
Technical, fingery and blind at the top. Excellent introduction to the wall.

**3\. Palm Springs (7a+) *★★***  
The left-hand line of two superb face climbs. Sustained more than technical.

**4\. A Million Destinies (7a+) *★★***  
harder and even better than its left-hand twin. 'Tweeky' edge climbing at its best.

**5\. Stay Hungry E5 6a**  
The crack. Dirty and needs bolting.

**6\. Digitorum Brevis (7b) *★★***  
The route of the wall. Named after a one-finger-move at one thirds height. Unthinkable.
