{.topo .w100}

A very fine wall that has suffered the ignominy of misuse. Compact, technical face climbing abounds and all the routes are worthwhile. Can suffer dampness after rain and in humidity.

**1\. The Creaming Dream (6c+) *★***  
A good intro to the wall. Slabby and technical
{.mt0}

**2\. Ice Cream Sunday (7a) *★***  
Very technical climbing with a stubborn finish. Hard. Rebolted.

**3\. Scream for Cream (7a+) *★***  
Thin and technical at the start, quite vicious really. Needs rebolting. Rebolted.

**4\. Trailblazer (7b) *★★***  
In many ways the route of the wall. Sustained and technical with a difficult rightwards finish. Rebolted.

**5\. Sink or Swim (7a+) *★***  
Sustained and airy climbing with a blind finish. Gold BRs.

**6\. Security Plus (7b) *★***  
Strenuous climbing on undercut holds. An easy start but difficult and complicated above. Rebolted.

**7\. Project**

**8\. Norman Normal (7a) *★***  
Bold start and hard finish. Just merits a French grade, worthwhile all the same. To be rebolted. Norman was never nothing more than normal! Rebolted.

**9\. Project**

**10\. All's Well (6b) *★***  
The warm up for the wall giving a very pleasant pitch. Rebolted.

**11\. The Bitter End (6b+)**  
Squeezed in onto the end of the wall. A tough crux. Rebolted.

**13\. Taffy Duck E3 6a *★★***  
The diagonal crackline across the wall starting from All's Well. As good as any on the wall. Mostly situ gear.
