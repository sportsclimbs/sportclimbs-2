These are gained by continuing along the track through a muddy section. After 300 yards the slabs appear on the right.

**1\. The Bony King of Nowhere (5+)**  
The leftmost route left of a clump of ivy. Poor.

**2\. Once Upon a Time (6a)**  
Just to the right of the ivy. Needs traffic.

**3\. Can the Can (6c)**  
The first of the technical slabs moving back to finish.

**4\. Palm (7a) *★***  
The left-centre of the slab via a vague orange depression.

**5\. Neil Kinnock's Last Stand (7a+) *★***  
The most technical route up the centre of the slab.

**6\. Chinese Whispers (6b+)**  
Perhaps the warm up for the harder routes on the right-hand side of the slab.

**7\. Glenys Encounters her First Limp Member (6a)**  
The right-hand edge of the slab. The first ascensionist is clearly in need of help!
