            <h2>South Wall</h2>

            <p>Although short, this wall provides three difficult routes requiring an abundance of both power and finesse combined. Can be damp in humid weather.</p>

            <p><b>1. Bristol Beat (7a+)</b> short but powerful climbing in its length. Keep going rightwards to the belay. </p>
            <p><b>2. Screaming Neutrino's (7b+) &starf;</b> an even more powerful sequence up the shallow pumping groove. Yet to be rebolted.</p>
            <p><b>3. It's a Black World (7a) &starf;</b> finesse at last. The clean black wall provides the intricate route of the wall. Black is certainly beautiful. </p>
            <p><b>4. Howling Hadrons (6b+) &starf; </b>right-hand side of wall with technical start and juggy finale.</p>

            <h2>The Back Wall </h2>

            <p>Perhaps, in many ways, this is the centrepiece of the quarry. Unfortunately, it does suffer from a large amount of seepage in the spring months. Once dry, it provides a fine collection of pitches on generally immaculate compact rock. The type of climbing is unique to the area. <span class="new">All of the routes need re-bolting.</span></p>

            <p><b>1. The Quartz Bicycle (6c+)</b> undercut flake, now gone. Needs rebolting and cleaning.</p>
            <p><b>2. You Never can Tell (7a) &starf;</b> technical, fingery and blind at the top. Excellent introduction to the wall. </p>
            <p><b>3. Palm Springs (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> the left-hand line of two superb face climbs. Sustained more than technical.</p>
            <p><b>4. A Million Destinies (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> harder and even better than its left-hand twin. 'Tweeky' edge climbing at its best. </p>
            <p><b>5. Stay Hungry E5 6a</b> the crack. Dirty and needs bolting. </p>
            <p><b>6. Digitorum Brevis (7b) &starf;&starf;</b> the route of the wall. Named after a one-finger-move at one thirds height. Unthinkable.</p>
