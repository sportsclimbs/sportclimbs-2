        <p>A very fine wall that has suffered the ignominy of misuse. Compact, technical face climbing abounds and all the routes are worthwhile. Can suffer dampness after rain and in humidity.</p>
        <p><b>1. The Creaming Dream (6c+) *</b> a good intro to the wall. Slabby and technical</p>
        <p><b>2. Ice Cream Sunday (7a) *</b> very technical climbing with a stubborn finish. Hard. <span class="new">Rebolted.</span></p>
        <p><b>3. Scream for Cream (7a+) </b>* thin and technical at the start, quite vicious really. Needs rebolting. <span class="new">Rebolted.</span></p>
        <p><b>4. Trailblazer (7b) **</b> in many ways the route of the wall. Sustained and technical with a difficult rightwards finish. <span class="new">Rebolted.</span></p>
        <p><b>5. Sink or Swim (7a+) *</b> sustained and airy climbing with a blind finish. Gold BRs. </p>
        <p><b>6. Security Plus (7b) *</b> strenuous climbing on undercut holds. An easy start but difficult and complicated above. Rebolted. </p>
        <p><b>7. Project</b></p>
        <p><b>8. Norman Normal (7a) *</b> bold start and hard finish. Just merits a French grade, worthwhile all the same. To be rebolted. Norman was never nothing more than normal! <span class="new">Rebolted.</span></p>
        <p><b>9. Project</b></p>
        <p><b>10. All's Well (6b) *</b> the warm up for the wall giving a very pleasant pitch. <span class="new">Rebolted.</span></p>
        <p><b>11. The Bitter End (6b+)</b> squeezed in onto the end of the wall. A tough crux. <span class="new">Rebolted.</span></p>
        <p><b>13. Taffy Duck E3 6a **</b> the diagonal crackline across the wall starting from All's Well. As good as any on the wall. Mostly situ gear.</p>

        <p><b>14. Tinker's Dog (6a) </b>the left-hand route is pleasantly sustained</p>
        <p><b>15. Full Metal Jacket (6b) </b>steep finale to finish at ledge.</p>
        <p><b>16. Any Old Iron (6c)</b> pleasant face to steep finale.</p>
        <p><b>17</b>, <b>Rag and Bone (6b) </b>pleasant face and steep finale</p>
        <p><b>18. Knackers Yard (6b+) </b>right again finishing up crack. Needs regearing.</p>
        <p><b>19. Sustainable Development (5+) </b>pleasant face to steep finale.</p>
