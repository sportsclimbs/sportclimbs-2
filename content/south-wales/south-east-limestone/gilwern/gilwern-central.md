A new section of crag in the central area of quarries beyond Gilwern main. It has ten routes all in the lower grades with a quick drying nature and generally good rock.

Access is fairly straightforward: take the turning by the pond and follow the road until 400m past the Lamb and Flag pub and park on the right where two tracks lead off towards the aerial. Take the right-hand track and after about 800m and after passing three blocks on the path the quarry will be seen on the left. There are two tiers.
