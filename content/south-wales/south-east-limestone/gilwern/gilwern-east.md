A very pleasant little crag with excellent rock, well bolted routes and ease of access. The crag face southeast and gets the sun until just after midday.

From the pond take the road past the Lamb and Flag and park about 400m after it where two roads/tracks branch off to the right. Follow the right-hand track until three large boulders block the path. Skirt down and to the right, actually across the top of the cliff, and then back left and carefully over a fence to the foot of the face.

Delicate and insecure moves leftwards lead to an easier finish.

**1 Petering Out (6b) *★***  
The crackline just right of What's the Craic to a steep finale.

**2 The Golden Tower (6c) *★***  
A technical exercise via the vague pillar. Look out for the apparently crucial 'ear'.

Great climbing on good holds through the area of bulging rock.

**5 Original start (6c) *★***  
The left-hand start to the next route does sometimes suffer from seepage.

The short corner and taxing moves to gain the juggy upper section where some care is needed.

The fine line of conglomerate provides some very juggy climbing.

More good holds past some even larger conglomerate.
