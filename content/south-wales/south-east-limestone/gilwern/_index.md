A delightful little crag situated on the edge of the Clydach Gorge on the Heads of the Valley Road between Abergervenny and Merthyr Tydfil.

The walls are very open with a very pleasing aspect and have a number of very good littel routes on perfect quality limestone.

## Conditions

The cliff is very open and can be subjected to strong winds. The walls face northwest and get the late afternoon/evening venue making it perfect for a summer's evening with gentle breezes.

## Approach

From Blaenavon take the B4246 for approximately 1.5 km and turn left at the keeper's pond towards The Lamb and Fox public house. Continue past the pub for 1.5km where the road turns sharply to the right and there is a steep drop on the left-hand side of the road: some road barriers clearly identify this spot. Just after the barriers end there is a small parking space on the left (2 cars) or alternatively park a little further on and walk back.

From the parking space a track leads up the hillside past the preliminary crags to the main crag 250m away.
