            <div class="topo">

                <p>A very pleasant little crag with excellent rock, well bolted routes and ease of access. The crag face southeast and gets the sun until just after midday.</p>
                <p>From the pond take the road past the Lamb and Flag and park about 400m after it where two roads/tracks branch off to the right. Follow the right-hand track until three large boulders block the path. Skirt down and to the right, actually across the top of the cliff, and then back left and carefully over a fence to the foot of the face.</p>

            <p><b>10 Quakering (6c) </b>the direct start to the next route is technical</p>

            <p><b>3 Half Pipe Dream (6c) *** </b>the well-sculputred water-worn groove gives a pleasant technical exercise</p>
            <p><b>4 Magic Carpet (6b) ** </b>great climbing on good holds through the area of bulging rock</p>
            <p><b>5 Original start (6c) * </b>the left-hand start to the next route does sometimes suffer from seepage</p>
            <p><b>6 Life on Planet Earth (6b+) </b>the short corner and taxing moves to gain the juggy upper section where some care is needed</p>
            <p><b>7 The Plumb (5) ** </b>the fine line of conglomerate provides some very juggy climbing</p>
