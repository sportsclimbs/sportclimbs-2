The Main Wall
-------------

![Pant Quarry topo](/img/south-wales/south-east-limestone/pantopo.gif)
{.topo}

The first routes start from the right-hand side of a terrace below the wall. This can be gained via a short gully and fixed rope. The first route starts atop another subsidiary pillar - it is advisable not to do this route whilst other people are climbing routes from the right-hand side of the terrace.

**1\. I Can, I Can’t (6b+) *★***  
The steep jug-filled wall with flakes and pockets.
{.mt0}

**2\. Totally Invalid (6c) *★***  
The first route uses gold BRs from right-hand of main terrace - just two or three hard moves.

**3\. Angela’s Ashes (6c) *★★***  
Fine wall climbing with hard moves through a small overlap. Excellent face climbing above.

**4\. Ponty Pandy (6c+) *★★***  
The next line has a hard start and much easier climbing above. Again excellent.

**5\. Llandfill-A-Gogoch (7b) *★★***  
A hard wall route identified by a thread runner. Very fingery.

**6\. Project**

**7\. Project**

**8\. Time to Dai (7b+) *★★***  
Climb direct above a tree by sustained climbing to a difficult finish on rounded holds.

**9\. Dai Laughing (8a) *★★★***  
A right-hand of a pair of superb routes on central section of wall. Sustained and hard. 60m rope required.

**10\. Maesteg-a-Saurus (8a) *★★★***  
This is the left-hand line which rejoins *Dai Laughing* at half height.

**11\. Total Pants (7a+) *★★***  
A superb, sustained test-piece straight up the wall above the initial ramp/flake. Low in grade with two or three long reaches.

**12\. Panteon Shot (7a) *★★***  
Climb a shallow groove to ledge system then continue up a difficult wall and superb groove above. A classic.

**13\. Unnamed (7a+) *★***  
The groove just left again after start of *Panteon Shot* (finishes at first double BB)

**14\. Unnamed (8a+) *★***  
Desperate direct start via rounded edges. Starts to the left of the initial BRs.

**15\. Welsh Fargo (7c+) *★★★***  
The classic of the wall taking the very slim crack system.

**Thieving Little Scrote (7c+) *★★★***  
The upper wall and huge flake left of *Welsh Fargo*.

**16\. Caught Mid Shot (6c+) *★***  
A poor flake line with projects above.

**17\. Unnamed (7b+) *★★***  
Has a desperately fingery lower wall. Three hard crimpy sections.

**18\. Herr Helmutt Schmutt (6b) *★***  
A potential warm up route starting via flake to a blue lower-off.

**19\. Helmet Cheese (7a) *★★***  
A long route taking a vague rib and overlap low down. The route continues to the second BB.

**20\. Pinch the Helmet (6b+) *★***  
Climb an angled flake to a ledge (6a) then rightward across wall to first BB of *Helmet Cheese*.

**21\. Radical Re-entry (7a) *★★★***  
This superb route climbs up a blunt rib and flake system. It's obvious by the sling on one of the bolts.

**22\. Unnamed (7a)**  
Short undercut crackline to ledge with four projects above the large corner to the left is

**23\. Twisted to Fit (7a+) *★★***  
Shallow groove to ledge, pillar above in two stages to large flake jug. Leftwards and up to finish via pillar.

**Clampitt’s Corner E1 5a**  
A huge corner line provides a trad route with a horrible start - can also be gained via the ledges above 22. BB at the top to lower-off.

50 metres to the left of the main wall is an isolated slab containing a row of BRs. This has been christened **Matt’s Slab (6b+) *★***
