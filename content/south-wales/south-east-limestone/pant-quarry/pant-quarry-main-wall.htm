            <p>The first routes start from the right-hand side of a terrace below the wall. This can be gained via a short gully and fixed rope. The first route starts atop another subsidiary pillar - it is advisable not to do this route whilst other people are climbing routes from the right-hand side of the terrace.</p>

            <p><b>1. I Can, I Can&rsquo;t (6b+) *</b> the steep jug-filled wall with flakes and pockets </p>
            <p><b>2. Totally Invalid (6c) *</b> first route via gold BRs from right-hand of main terrace - just two or three hard moves </p>
            <p><b>3. Angela&rsquo;s Ashes (6c) **</b> Fine wall climbing with hard moves through a small overlap. Excellent face climbing above </p>
            <p><b>4. Ponty Pandy (6c+) **</b> next line with a hard start and much easier climbing above. Again excellent </p>
            <p><b>5. Llandfill-A-Gogoch (7b) **</b> A hard wall route identified by a thread runner. Very fingery</p>
            <p><b>6. Project</b></p>
            <p><b>7. Project </b></p>
            <p><b>8. Time to Dai (7b+) ** </b>direct above tree by sustained climbing to a difficult finish on rounded holds </p>
            <p><b>9. Dai Laughing (8a) ***</b> right-hand of a pair of superb routes on central section of wall. Sustained and hard. 60m rope required</p>
            <p><b>10. Maesteg-a-Saurus (8a) ***</b> left-hand line rejoining Dai laughing at half height </p>
            <p><b>11. Total Pants (7a+) **</b> a superb sustained test-piece straight up the wall above the initial ramp/flake. Low in grade with two or three long reaches </p>
            <p><b>12. Panteon Shot (7a) **</b> shallow groove to ledge system, difficult wall and superb groove above. A classic </p>
            <p><b>13. Unnamed (7a+) *</b> groove just left again after start of Panteon Shot (finishes at first double BB) </p>
            <p><b>14. Unnamed (8a+) *</b> desperate direct start via rounded edges. Starts left of initial BRs</p>
            <p><b>15. Welsh Fargo (7c+) ***</b> the classic of the wall taking the very slim crack system </p>
            <p><b>Thieving Little Scrote (7c+) ***</b> the upper wall and huge flake left of Welsh Fargo </p>
            <p><b>16. Caught Mid Shot (6c+) *</b> poor flake line with projects above </p>
            <p><b>17. Unnamed (7b+) **</b> desperately fingery lower wall. Three hard crimpy sections </p>
            <p><b>18. Herr Helmutt Schmutt (6b) *</b> warm up starting via flake to blue lower-off</p>
            <p><b>19. Helmet Cheese (7a) **</b> a long route taking a vague rib and overlap low down. The route continues to the second BB </p>
            <p><b>20. Pinch the Helmet (6b+) * </b>angled flake to ledge (6a) then rightward across wall to first BB of Helmet Cheese </p>
            <p><b>21. Radical Re-entry (7a) ***</b> superb route via blunt rib and flake system obvious by sling on BR </p>
            <p><b>22. Unnamed (7a)</b> short undercut crackline to ledge with four projects above the large corner to the left is</p>
            <p><b>23. Twisted to Fit (7a+) **</b> shallow groove to ledge, pillar above in two stages to large flake jug. Leftwards and up to finish via pillar. </p>
            <p><b>Clampitt&rsquo;s Corner E1 5a</b> huge corner line provides a trad. route with a horrible start - can also be gained via the ledges above 22. BB at the top to lower-off </p>
            <p>50 to the left of the main wall is an isolated slab containing a row of BRs. This has been christened <b>Matt&rsquo;s Slab (6b+) * </b></p>
