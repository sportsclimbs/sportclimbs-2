            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p><img src="/img/south-wales/south-east-limestone/pantmap1.gif" width="270" height="242"><img src="/img/south-wales/south-east-limestone/pantmap2.gif" width="325" height="246">Pant Quarry is a few miles south of Bridgend and a about 10 minutes off the M4. </p>
            <p>If travelling from the east come off the M4 at junction 35 on to the A48. Follow this westwards and at the third roundabout turn left heading south on to the B4625 Ewenny Road. Follow this for 3km, through Ewenny, and the quarry is on the left.</p>

            <p>When approaching from the west come off the M4 at junction 37 and turn left heading north. At the first roundabout turn right on to the A48 heading east. After 9km turn off the main road towards Ewenny on the B4265 Ewenny Road. After 3km the quarry can be see on the left.</p>
                
            <p>Parking in the gate is not a good idea as this will draw attention to climbers. The best place to park is in a series of lay-bys further down the road. A better alternative is to follow the road past the quarry for a further 400m and take a right turn, this is just before a cattle grid, and follow this onto the common. Park on the grass here and walk along the track, following the line of telegraph poles, until the quarry is seen on the right. Quarry tracks on the right-hand side of the quarry then lead down into its base.</p>

            <h3>Access</h3>

            <p>Judging by the signs it is obvious that Tarmac do not want climbers using this quarry whether it be for Health and Safety reasons or for the fact that they clearly wish to use the quarry for other purposes. If a sensible and discreet approach is made then climbing will continue for at least the near future.</p>
