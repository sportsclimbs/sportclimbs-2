## Situation

This large open quarry can easily be found on right-hand side of the A4265 when travelling from Bridgend to Southerndown. It is the large, recently departed quarry with the 'Climbing Prohibited' signs on its front gates!

## Character

The main feature of the quarry is a 100m long by 40m high wall of superb soft-grained limestone. This is undoubtedly one of the best pieces of rock on inland Welsh Limestone. This provides a large number of hard pitches of the fingery and technical style. They dry very quickly after rain, the wall faces south and is the ideal autumn/winter/spring venue There are a number of other easier routes scattered about the quarry.
