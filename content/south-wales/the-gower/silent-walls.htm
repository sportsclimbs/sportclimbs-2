            <p>Situated about 100m further on than Black Wall right, this bay of rock is easily reached by the obvious fisherman's path: it lies about 300m before the building atop the cliffs. It has a handful of good little routes.</p>
            <p> <b>1.Nick's Corner HVS 5a </b>the obvious corner </p>
            <p> <b>2.</b> <b>OK Squire(6a+) </b> excellent slab just right </p>
            <p> <b>3.Freeloader's Arete (6a+) </b>the right-hand side of the slab </p>
            <p> <b>4.It's oh so Quiet (6b) &starf; </b>the arete gained from the left with a tricky start move. Add a plus for the short </p>
            <p> <b>5.Noisiness (6b) </b> the unusual open groove line. </p>
            <p> <b>6.Bedlam (6b) </b>a leftwards line via a technical slab and crimpy finishing wall </p>
            <p> <b>7.</b> <b>White Noise (6c+) &starf;&starf; </b> the arete taken on its left-hand side with some smart 'fridge hugging' above the overlap. Excellent and tough for the grade. </p>
