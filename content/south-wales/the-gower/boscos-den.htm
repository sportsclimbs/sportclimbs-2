            <p>Bosco&rsquo;s Bosco&rsquo;s A new crag in the heart of Gower with very easy access and a host of sport routes and trad. routes. It lies 300m east of Minchin Hole in a very pleasant &lsquo;gulch&rsquo;. The cliff is tidally affected save for the cave area.</p>

            <p>To reach the cliff follow the coast path eastwards from Southgate National Trust car park along the edge of the plateau until 100m after the cliff-top &lsquo;chair&rsquo; (this approximately 800m beyond the car park). From here descent a small bluff and follow a diagonal path down the hillside to a prominent &lsquo;cutout&rsquo; on the sea&rsquo;s edge. At low tide you can walk easily around to the cliff&rsquo;s base or at high tide it is possible to abseil in. If the tide cuts off access the only way back to the top is up the abseil descent rope: tide tables are essential for climbing here.</p>
