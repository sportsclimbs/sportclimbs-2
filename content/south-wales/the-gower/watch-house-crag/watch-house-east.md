**1. Left Wing Rebolt (6b) *★*** 
Climb up to a ledge then follow the arete above.

**2. Strain Drain (7a)**  
Climb up onto a rail and over the bulges.


**3. Straining Pitch (6b) *★***  
A steep start leads to easier climbing on big holds. A short slab leads to an overlap finale.

**4. Touch and Go (7a+)**  
Tackle the bulges right of *Straining Pitch*.

**5. Jump to Conclusions (7a) *★***  
Climb directly up the wall with a big move through the overlap via a flat hold.

**6. Pump Action (7a+) *★***  
Takes the blanker-looking section of the wall with final difficult moves over an overlap.

**7. Clip Joint (6c) *★***  
A superb little route via the red-stained groove with a crux exit. Easier slabs above.

**8. No Rest for the Wicked (7a) *★***  
The left-hand of two pumpy problems starting from behind the boulder and not touching it.

**9. Too Many Fingers (7a) *★***  
A leftwards line across the overhanging wall keeping just off its right-hand arete.

**Nia Miss (5+)**  
The traverse. Long slings useful to avoid rope drag.
