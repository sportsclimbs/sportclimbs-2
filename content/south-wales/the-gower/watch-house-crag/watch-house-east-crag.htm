            <p>From the parking area at Southgate, follow the road westwards until the last house and break out across the plateau to its edge. Drop down the eastern side of a promontory keeping to the eastern edge of a sharply-cut zawn. Once a rocky platform just above the tide level has been reached, traverse back to the east to find the crag in the first zawn gained.</p>

            <p>Do not climb here two hours either side of high tide.</p>

            <p><b>1. Straining Pitch (6b+) * </b>a steep start leads to easier climbing on big holds. A short slab leads to an overlap finale. </p>
            <p><b>2. Project </b></p>
            <p><b>3. Jump to Conclusions (7a) * </b>direct up the wall with a big move through the overlap via a flat hold</p>
            <p><b>4. Pump Action (7a+) * </b>climbs the blanker-looking section of wall with final difficult moves over an overlap.</p>
            <p><b>5. Clip Joint (6c) * </b>a superb little route via the red-stained groove with a crux exit. Easier slabs above. </p>
            <p><b>6. No Rest for the Wicked (7a) * </b>the left-hand of two pumpy problems starting from behind the boulder and not touching it.</p>
            <p><b>7. Name not Known (7a) * </b>a leftwards line across the overhanging wall keeping just off its right-hand arete.</p>
