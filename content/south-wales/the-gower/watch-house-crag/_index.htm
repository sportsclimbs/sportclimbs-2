            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>A super little find with a handful of excellent routes on superb, water-washed limestone. The climbing is quite unusual in that it features tiny holds and smears on a fine slab tucked into the back of a small zawn. A perfect compliment to the crags nearby</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>From the parking area at Southgate, follow the road westwards until the last house and break out across the plateau to its edge. Drop down the eastern side of a promontory keeping to the eastern edge of a sharply-cut zawn. Once the foot of the zawn is reached, circle back into to it where the slab will be revealed.</p>
