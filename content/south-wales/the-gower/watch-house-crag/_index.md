## Character

These two crags, about 100m apart, have very different characters.

### Watch House Slab

A super little find with a handful of excellent routes on superb, water-washed limestone. The climbing is quite unusual in that it features tiny holds and smears on a fine slab tucked into the back of a small zawn. A perfect compliment to the crags nearby.

### Watch House East

An alarmingly overhanging wall with a handful of excellent steep test-pieces. Compliments both Fox Hole and Watch House Slab.

## Approaches

### Watch House Slab

From the parking area at Southgate, follow the road westwards until the last house and break out across the plateau to its edge. Drop down the eastern side of a promontory keeping to the eastern edge of a sharply-cut zawn. Once the foot of the zawn is reached, circle back into to it where the slab will be revealed.

### Watch House East

From the parking area at Southgate, follow the road westwards until the last house and break out across the plateau to its edge. Drop down the eastern side of a promontory keeping to the eastern edge of a sharply-cut zawn. Once a rocky platform just above the tide level has been reached, traverse back to the east to find the crag in the first zawn gained.

Do not climb here two hours either side of high tide.
