            <p>This crag is gained by descending the path from the car park at Rhossilli onto the beach and turning east to gain the first prominent cove - Shipwreck Cove. Black Wall is situated 100m left of this and can be accessed up to 2 hours after high tide.</p>

            <p><b>1. Thieving Little Parasites (6a) </b>left-hand of two lines on the angled wall on the left of the crag.</p>

            <p><b>2. Wittle Thieving Lankers (4) &starf; </b>the right-hand line.</p>

            <p><b>3. Fats Waller (6c+) &starf; </b>the slim corner is harder than it looks.</p>

            <p><b>4. The Route with Two Pockets (7b) &starf; </b>easy to the steep wall with, guess what, two pockets</p>

            <p><b>5. Black Adder (6c) &starf; </b>small holds on the wall lead to a steeper finale with good holds</p>
            <p><b>6. The Strongbow Flyer (6b) </b>a tricky start then no great thereafter</p>

            <p> <b>7. Rum Thieves (6b+) &starf; </b>direct up the wall is better </p>
