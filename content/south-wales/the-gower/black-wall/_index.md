This crag is gained by descending the path from the car park at Rhossilli onto the beach and turning east to gain the first prominent cove - Shipwreck Cove. Black Wall is situated 100m left of this and can be accessed up to 2 hours after high tide.

**1\. Thieving Little Parasites (6a)** left-hand of two lines on the angled wall on the left of the crag.

**2\. Wittle Thieving Lankers (4) ★** the right-hand line.

**3\. Fats Waller (6c+) ★** the slim corner is harder than it looks.

**4\. The Route with Two Pockets (7b) ★** easy to the steep wall with, guess what, two pockets

**5\. Black Adder (6c) ★** small holds on the wall lead to a steeper finale with good holds

**6\. The Strongbow Flyer (6b)** a tricky start then no great thereafter

**7\. Rum Thieves (6b+) ★** direct up the wall is better
