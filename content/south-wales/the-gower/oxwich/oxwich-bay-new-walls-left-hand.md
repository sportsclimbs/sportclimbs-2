**Load of Bullocks (6a)** isolated route up barrel-shaped buttress on left.

**1\. Underneath the Larches (6b+)** pleasant climbing on the left-hand side of the wall with a tricky steep start.

**2\. Life's Too Short (6c) ★★** fine fingery climbing on the right-hand side of the smooth wall.

**3\. Snatched from the Cradle (6b) ★** surprisingly fingery climbing via a thin crack above a hole.

**4\. Cradle Snatcher (5) ★** a good warm-up via the slim groove with a steep start over the overlap.

**5\. Baby Boing Boing (6c+) ★** another good little route via an overlap and smooth groove.

**6\. Laughing Boy (7b)** power climbing with fingery pulls to a desperate twisting finale.

**7\. Baby Bouncer (6c+) ★★** superb sustained face climbing with good moves. Low in grade.

**8\. Teenage Kicks (6c+) ★** superb climbing via the vague hanging arete.

**9\. My Inheritance (6b+)** slightly squeezed into the wall to the right, gained from the start of the groove.

**10\. Ox-Over Moon (6a+) ★** steep juggy moves into prominent groove. Exit rightwards, airy.
