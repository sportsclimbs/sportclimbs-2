**Load of Bullocks (6a)**  
Isolated route up barrel-shaped buttress on left.

**1. Underneath the Larches (6b+)**  
Pleasant climbing on the left-hand side of the wall with a tricky steep start.

**2. Life's Too Short (6c) *★★***  
Fine fingery climbing on the right-hand side of the smooth wall.

**3. Snatched from the Cradle (6b) *★***  
Surprisingly fingery climbing via a thin crack above a hole.

**4. Cradle Snatcher (5) *★***  
A good warm-up via the slim groove with a steep start over the overlap.

**5. Baby Boing Boing (6c+) *★***  
Another good little route via an overlap and smooth groove.

**6. Laughing Boy (7b)**  
Power climbing with fingery pulls to a desperate twisting finale.

**7. Baby Bouncer (6c+) *★★***  
Superb sustained face climbing with good moves. Low in grade.

**8. Teenage Kicks (6c+) *★***  
Superb climbing via the vague hanging arête.

**9. My Inheritance (6b+)**  
Slightly squeezed into the wall to the right, gained from the start of the groove.

**10. Ox-Over Moon (6a+) *★***  
Steep juggy moves into prominent groove. Exit rightwards, airy.
