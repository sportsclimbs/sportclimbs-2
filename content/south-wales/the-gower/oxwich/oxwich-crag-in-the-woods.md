To the left of the descent is a small buttress with 5 routes. From left to right: **Unnamed (F6c+)** Desperate move past single BR, **Open Verdict(F6b+)** Start up tiny groove, **Swift Justice (VS 4c)** main groove, **Before the Beak (F7a+)** arête and **the Jury's Out (F7a)** right-most line. There are also other projects in between.
