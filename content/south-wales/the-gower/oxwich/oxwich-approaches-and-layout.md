## Approach

![Oxwich map](/img/south-wales/the-gower/oxwich-map.png)
Firstly locate Oxwich Bay, clearly signposted from most routes onto the Gower and park on the beach (£2 at the time of writing). From here there are two alternatives:

1.  If the tide is out, contour the right edge of the beach until the crag is visible on the right after a short spur of rock. Access is then obvious.
2.  Should the tide be in, follow the track past the church and after climbing a short set of steps branch off left. The track traverse the lip of a ravine and then breaks off into the forest After 400 yards trend down and leftwards, vague, until the cliff edge is gained and a small gully can be descended to the end of the cliff.

## Layout

The cliff consists of two main areas: the Sea (red) Walls, obvious by name provide an easily accessible wall direct from a sea level platform: ‘The Crag in the Woods’ lies beyond this with an area of woodland surrounding it. It's gently overhanging for most of its length with walls, grooves and arêtes in abundance.
