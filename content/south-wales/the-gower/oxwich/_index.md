Most of the main cliff at Oxwich has fallen down and all that remains now is the far left side. 'The Crag in the Woods' is still climbable.

‘The Crag in the Woods’ has an area of woodland surrounding it. It's gently overhanging for most of its length with walls, grooves and arêtes in abundance.

## Approach

### Main crag

Firstly locate Oxwich Bay, clearly signposted from most routes onto the Gower and park on the beach (£2 at the time of writing). From here there are two alternatives:

1.  If the tide is out, contour the right edge of the beach until the crag is visible on the right after a short spur of rock. Access is then obvious.
2.  Should the tide be in, follow the track past the church and after climbing a short set of steps branch off left. The track traverse the lip of a ravine and then breaks off into the forest After 400 yards trend down and leftwards, vague, until the cliff edge is gained and a small gully can be descended to the end of the cliff.

### The Crag in the Woods

Follow the footpaths marked past the church and around the woods to some steps behind 'The Crag in the Woods'.
