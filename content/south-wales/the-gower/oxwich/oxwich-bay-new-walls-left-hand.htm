            <p><b>Load of Bullocks (6a) </b>isolated route up barrel-shaped buttress on left.</p>

            <p><b>1. Underneath the Larches (6b+) </b>pleasant climbing on the left-hand side of the wall with a tricky steep start.</p>
            <p><b>2. Life's Too Short (6c) ** </b>fine fingery climbing on the right-hand side of the smooth wall.</p>
            <p><b>3. Snatched from the Cradle (6b) *</b> surprisingly fingery climbing via a thin crack above a hole.</p>
            <p><b>4. Cradle Snatcher (5) * </b>a good warm-up via the slim groove with a steep start over the overlap.</p>
            <p><b>5. Baby Boing Boing (6c+) * </b>another good little route via an overlap and smooth groove.</p>
            <p><b>6. Laughing Boy (7b) </b>power climbing with fingery pulls to a desperate twisting finale.</p>
            <p><b>7. Baby Bouncer (6c+) ** </b>superb sustained face climbing with good moves. Low in grade.</p>
            <p><b>8. Teenage Kicks (6c+) * </b>superb climbing via the vague hanging arete.</p>
            <p><b>9. My Inheritance (6b+) </b>slightly squeezed into the wall to the right, gained from the start of the groove.</p>
            <p><b>10. Ox-Over Moon (6a+) * </b>steep juggy moves into prominent groove. Exit rightwards, airy.</p>
