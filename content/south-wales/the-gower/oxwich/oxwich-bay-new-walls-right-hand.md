**1\. Devil's Brew (6a+)** faint crackline with lower bulge soon yields to easier ground.

**2\. Cauldron of Satyr (6b) ★** crackline and slight groove to steeper wall via break.

**3\. Filthy Snatch (6b) ★** fine, blank looking wall taken slightly left of BRs.

**4\. Cradle of Dirt HVS 5a ★** prominent crackline.

**5\. Dirt Box E2 5c** steep start via difficult wall, 2PRs, then easier crackline

**6\. Anoek Clear Missile (6b)** thin face climbing on a narrow pillar

**7\. Soil and Shuvel (6a+)** pleasant shallow groove line

**8\. Hubble Rubble (6b) ★** fine intoxicate wall heading for bottomless corner gives excellent moves.

**9\. Toxicology (6c+)** short steep wall with fingery moves.

**10\. Unnamed (6a+) ★** Fine climbing leftwards via a faint groove system

**11\. Anal Gesia (6b+)** technical and intricate face climbing.

**12\. Suppose I Try (6a)** ★ shallow groove and thin crackline

**13\. Unnamed (6c)** leftwards line via square-cute groove.
