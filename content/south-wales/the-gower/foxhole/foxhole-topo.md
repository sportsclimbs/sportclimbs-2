The first 4 routes a just off the topo a few metres to the left.
{.mt0}

**Never Out-Fox the Fox (5)**  
Climb the black slab starting from a grassy bank. Follow the break up and left then climb the wall above.

**Cunning Little Fox (5)**  
Start right the black slab. Climb up to a groove and follow this to a ramp on the left. From the top of the ramp climb straight up to the belay.

**Vulpes V ulpes (5)**  
As for the previous route but instead of taking the ramp follow the juggy groove line all the way.

**Vulpix (4+)**  
A pleasant exercise in bridging up the cleaned runnel to the left of *Basis Brush*.

**1. Basil Brush (4+) *★***  
The first and easiest route on the crag.

**2. Unholy Alliance (6a+) *★***  
Steep open climbing. A good warm up for the harder routes.

**3. Marmalade Skies (7a) *★***  
An eliminate line up the steep orangey streak.

**4. Connard Canard (7b) *★***  
A very steep line up a grey streak. Two hard moves compliant on a long reach and a strong left arm.

**5. Goose 'n Lucy (6c+) *★★★***  
Magnificent jug pulling up the right-hand side of the pillar, almost in the cave. A hard start and complex finish. 

**6. Lucky Lizzy (6c+)**  
A link up joining *Goose'n'Lucy* with the top of *Pioneers..*. From the belay on *Goose..* move right to finish up *Pioneers..*.

**7. Surplomb De Ray (8b)  *★★***  
Battle through the overhang to the tufa jug on on *Pioneers..* and finish up that route.

**8. Pioneers of the Hypnotic Groove (7b) *★★★***  
Brilliant sustained climbing up the groove at the back of the cave. One badly placed bolt and lots of effort required.

**9. Salva Mea (8a) *★★★***  
Start at a yellow wall at the edge of the cave. Climb to a jug halfway and climb steeply up an left to the slab. Lower off on *Palace..*.

**L'Enigma et le Renard (8a) *★***  
Links *Palace..* into *Salva Mea* from the second bolt on the former.


**10. Palace of Swords Reversed (8a) *★★***  
Powerful. Two vicious moves on the alarmingly overhanging wall.

**11. Chicken Licken (6c+)**  
A short, sharp shock up the overhanging arête.

**12. Foxy Lady (7a) *★★***  
A magnificent route. Climb the left arête to a ledge then continue up lefthand line of bolts on the head wall. You can also start up *Chicken Licken* to get **Foxy Chicken (7a+)**.

**13. No Epoxy Au Oxley (6b+)**  
Climb *Foxy Lady* to grassy ledges and follow these leftwards to join *Pioneers of the Hypnotic Groove*. Finish up this.

**14. Gypsy Eyes (6b+) *★***  
As the last route but climb the headwall to the right of *Pioneers..*

**15. Little Miss Lover (7a) *★***  
Climb *Foxy Lady* to the grassy ledge. Move left to some comglomorate and climb the wall left of this.

**16. The Hooker (7a) *★★***  
Another superb sustained pitch with a sting in the tail. Start up *Foxy Lady* to the ledge and take the first line of bolts from the right. 

**17. Joy de Viva (7a+) *★★★***  
A magnificent direct pitch, sustained and fingery but still low in its respective grade. A long reach helps.

**18. Fowl Play (7b) *★★***  
Start up *Chicken Licken* to the fourth bolt. Move right and onto *Joy de Viva*. Follow this for a few moves then move right again before climbing straight up the headwall. Marked in red for clarity.

**19. Power Struggle (7b+) *★★***  
A fine fingery pitch on crisp little edges and side-pulls. A long reach helps after a peculiar start.

**20. Ducky Lucky (7a+) *★★***  
Superb climbing with a long reach or a very technical move. Still low in the grade.


**21. The Day the Sky Fell In (6b+) *★***  
Pleasant jug-pulling warm up on fringes of wall.

The following 3 routes are leftward rising traverses.
{.csa .mt4}

**23. Poulty in Motion (7b+) *★★★***  
Take a leftwards exit from the third bolt of *The Day the Sky Fell In* and follow the rising traverse line across *Ducky Lucky*, *Power Struggle* and the other routes all the way to the belay of *Foxy Lady*. Pumpy.

**Turkey Lurking (7c) *★★***  
A shorter version of *Poultry..* starting up *Power Struggle*. From the fourth bolt on *Power Struggle* break out left to continue as for the previous route.

**24. Where the Fox That? (7b+) *★★***  
Climb *The Day the Sky Fell In* to the break just below the top and follow this leftwards to the lower off on *Joy de Viva*.
