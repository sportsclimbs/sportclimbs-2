**1\. Unnamed VS 4c** The corner, obvious by name

**2\. Barnacles at Dawn (6c) ★** easiest on the wall with a balancy start, an awkward move left and a crank for the top. Suffers seepage.

**3\. Pray for the Cray (7a+) ★★** slightly leftwards trending crackline with culminates in the final difficult pull

**4\. Lobster Bisque (7b) ★** another vague crackline which is OK until the desperately fingery finale.

**5\. Oyster Party (7a) ★** a super little wall climb with technical moves away from gear at the top. Belay on right.

**6\. Vladimir and the Pearl (6c) ★★** the central line of the wall leftwards via a prominent crackline.

**7\. Shellin' Out (7b) ★★** another relatively sustained affair with a sting in the tail.

**8\. King Prawn (7a) ★** a series of thin cracks with good holds until the last move.

**9\. Man or Mollusk (7b) ★** the final route of the wall, just left of the corner once again saves the hardest till last.

**10\. Telpyn Corner HVS 5a** Obvious by name

**11\. Mussel Man (5)** the arete on the right-hand side of the wall.

**12\. Moule Mariniere (6a) ★** the pleasant centre of the wall to the right.

**13\. Ma Moule Don't Like U Laffin (4)** the easier wall right again moving left from the last BR.

30 metres to the right is a south facing wall set in a small zawn. This offers four worthwhile routes:

**Taxi to the Ocean (7a) ★★** the impressive left-hand arete, gained from the left before transferring onto the overhanging side.

**Diving for Pearls (6b) ★** the centre of the fine overlapped wall. Short but excellent. Jugs, jugs, jugs.

**Sea Fairer (6a) ★** the overlaps above a groove start.

**Glug, Glug, Glug (6a)** the wall to the right utilising the same belay.
