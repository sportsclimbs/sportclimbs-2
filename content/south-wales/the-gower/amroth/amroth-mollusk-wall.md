{.topo .w100}

**1. Unnamed VS 4c**  
The corner, obvious by name

**2. Barnacles at Dawn (6c) *★***  
Easiest on the wall with a balancy start, an awkward move left and a crank for the top. Suffers seepage.

**3. Pray for the Cray (7a+) *★★***  
Slightly leftwards trending crackline with culminates in the final difficult pull

**4. Lobster Bisque (7b) *★***  
Another vague crackline which is OK until the desperately fingery finale.

**5. Oyster Party (7a) *★***  
A super little wall climb with technical moves away from gear at the top. Belay on right.

**6. Vladimir and the Pearl (6c) *★★***  
The central line of the wall leftwards via a prominent crackline.

**7. Shellin' Out (7b) *★★***  
Another relatively sustained affair with a sting in the tail.

**8. King Prawn (7a) *★***  
A series of thin cracks with good holds until the last move.

**9. Man or Mollusk (7b) *★***  
The final route of the wall, just left of the corner once again saves the hardest till last.

**10. Telpyn Corner HVS 5a**  
Obvious by name

**11. Mussel Man (5)**  
The arête on the right-hand side of the wall.

**12. Moule Mariniere (6a) *★***  
The pleasant centre of the wall to the right.

**13. Ma Moule Don't Like U Laffin (4)**  
The easier wall right again moving left from the last BR.

30 metres to the right is a south facing wall set in a small zawn. This offers four worthwhile routes:

**Taxi to the Ocean (7a) *★★***  
The impressive left-hand arête, gained from the left before transferring onto the overhanging side.

**Diving for Pearls (6b) *★***  
The centre of the fine overlapped wall. Short but excellent. Jugs, jugs, jugs.

**Sea Fairer (6a) *★***  
The overlaps above a groove start.

**Glug, Glug, Glug (6a)**  
The wall to the right utilising the same belay.
