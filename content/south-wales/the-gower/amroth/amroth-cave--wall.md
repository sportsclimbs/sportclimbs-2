**1\. Project**

**2\. The Ego Sanction (6c+) *★★***  
the right-hand side of the cave gives a jug-filled experience ( the hollow block is lock in place) to reach its right-hand lip. Fine endurance climbing up the headwall via a slim overlap gives a superb finale.

**3\. Mental Message (6a+)**  
The shallow groove line bordering the right-hand side of the cave gives pleasant climbing to a half-height belay. The upper section is superb.

**4\. Men from Boys E2 5a, 5b**  
Trad line via arête and groove to ledge finishing by fine jamming crack.

**5\. Safe Connection (5+)**  
The centre of the wall to the right via a thin crack system.

**6\. Innocents Abroad (6a)**  
branches right to climb wall.
