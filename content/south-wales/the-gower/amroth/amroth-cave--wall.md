            <p><b>1. Project</b></p>
            <p><b>2. The Ego Sanction (6c+) &starf;&starf; </b>the right-hand side of the cave gives a jug-filled experience ( the hollow block is lock in place) to reach its right-hand lip. Fine endurance climbing up the headwall via a slim overlap gives a superb finale.</p>
            <p><b>3. Mental Message (6a+) </b>the shallow groove line bordering the right-hand side of the cave gives pleasant climbing to a half-height belay. The upper section is superb.</p>
            <p><b>4. Men from Boys E2 5a, 5b </b>trad line via arete and groove to ledge finishing by fine jamming crack.</p>
            <p><b>5. Safe Connection (5+) </b>the centre of the wall to the right via a thin crack system.</p>
            <p><b>6. Innocents Abroad (6a) </b> branches right to climb wall.</p>
