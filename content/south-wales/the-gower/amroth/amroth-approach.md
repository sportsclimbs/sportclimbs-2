The baked sandstone rock together with its quarried nature, particular on the Mollusk Wall, gives it an amenable atmosphere accompanied with the opportunity to wander off and take a dip at will. In stark contrast to this, the Tremors Wall and Cave Area, offer impressive overhanging faces which have deterred one notable nervous activist. These are intimidating routes, not to be underestimated.

The cliffs as a whole dry quite quickly but can suffer from seepage on the Mollusk Wall and are not pleasant in humid weather when the crimps can feel awfully slimy.

The easier approach is locate the village of Amroth and follow the road eastwards along the from until it veers off to the left inland. You will cross a small bridge by a pub and the road goes up a short incline and levels out. Where it begins to dip and the road opens out, just before a camping field, park on the right alongside a public footpath sign.

From here follow the path down and go down some steps on the left, before it goes right and down onto the beech. At the foot of the steps go over a small bridge and hop over the fence into Camarthenshire Follow the path for 250 yards until a wooden finger post can be seen on the right. The cliffs lie below this and can be gained by easy rocks on the right-hand side of the cliff facing out.

The cliff is tidal but the Mollusk Walls can be climbed on at high tide when a big swell is not running.
