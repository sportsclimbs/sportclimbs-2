            <p><b>1. Little Shrimp (6a+) </b>an isolated wall over to the left. Two hard moves.</p>
            <p><b>2. Cure HVS 5a </b>a vague crackline on the left-hand side of the wall complete with PR.</p>
            <p><b>3. Wrasse (6b) &starf; </b>a short fingery wall leads to a ledge. Above the shallow groove proves steep but juggy. </p>
            <p><b>4. Cast Adrift (6a+) &starf; </b>gains the wall by a stiff pull just left of the cave. The wall above is again juggy.</p>
            <p><b>5. Hook, Line and Stinker (6a+) &starf; </b>the steeper wall to the right has superb hidden holds.</p>
            <p><b>6. A Fisherman's Tackle (6b) &starf; </b>the shallow groove line with a hard move through the overlap.</p>
            <p><b>7. Sprats from the Captain's Table (5) </b>the wall to the right has a ledge ledge above and below which provides two tricky moves. </p>
            <p><b>8. Top Mouth Gudgeon (5) </b>the left-hand thin crack in the side wall complete with overlap.</p>
            <p><b>9. Leger System (5) </b>the next thin crack above the overhang to the left.</p>
            <p><b>Canny Ling (5) </b>the final thin crack just left of the large corner.</p>
