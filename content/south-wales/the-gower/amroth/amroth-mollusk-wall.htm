            <p><b>1. Unnamed VS 4c </b>The corner, obvious by name</p>
            <p><b>2. Barnacles at Dawn (6c) * </b>easiest on the wall with a balancy start, an awkward move left and a crank for the top. Suffers seepage.</p>
            <p><b>3. Pray for the Cray (7a+) ** </b>slightly leftwards trending crackline with culminates in the final difficult pull</p>
            <p><b>4. Lobster Bisque (7b) * </b>another vague crackline which is OK until the desperately fingery finale.</p>
            <p><b>5. Oyster Party (7a) * </b>a super little wall climb with technical moves away from gear at the top. Belay on right.</p>
            <p><b>6. Vladimir and the Pearl (6c) ** </b>the central line of the wall leftwards via a prominent crackline.</p>
            <p><b>7. Shellin' Out (7b) ** </b>another relatively sustained affair with a sting in the tail.</p>
            <p><b>8. King Prawn (7a) * </b>a series of thin cracks with good holds until the last move.</p>
            <p><b>9. Man or Mollusk (7b) * </b>the final route of the wall, just left of the corner once again saves the hardest till last. </p>
            <p><b>10. Telpyn Corner HVS 5a </b>Obvious by name</p>
            <p><b>11. Mussel Man (5) </b>the arete on the right-hand side of the wall.</p>
            <p><b>12. Moule Mariniere (6a) * </b>the pleasant centre of the wall to the right.</p>
            <p><b>13. Ma Moule Don't Like U Laffin (4) </b>the easier wall right again moving left from the last BR.</p>

            <p>30 metres to the right is a south facing wall set in a small zawn. This offers four worthwhile routes:</p>

            <p><b>Taxi to the Ocean (7a) ** </b>the impressive left-hand arete, gained from the left before transferring onto the overhanging side.</p>
            <p><b>Diving for Pearls (6b) * </b>the centre of the fine overlapped wall. Short but excellent. Jugs, jugs, jugs.</p>
            <p><b>Sea Fairer (6a) * </b>the overlaps above a groove start. </p>
            <p><b>Glug, Glug, Glug (6a) </b>the wall to the right utilising the same belay.</p>
