**1. Little Shrimp (6a+)**  
an isolated wall over to the left. Two hard moves.

**2. Cure HVS 5a**  
a vague crackline on the left-hand side of the wall complete with PR.

**3. Wrasse (6b) *★***  
a short fingery wall leads to a ledge. Above the shallow groove proves steep but juggy.

**4. Cast Adrift (6a+) *★***  
gains the wall by a stiff pull just left of the cave. The wall above is again juggy.

**5. Hook, Line and Stinker (6a+) *★***  
the steeper wall to the right has superb hidden holds.

**6. A Fisherman's Tackle (6b) *★***  
the shallow groove line with a hard move through the overlap.

**7. Sprats from the Captain's Table (5)**  
the wall to the right has a ledge ledge above and below which provides two tricky moves.

**8. Top Mouth Gudgeon (5)**  
the left-hand thin crack in the side wall complete with overlap.

**9. Leger System (5)**  
the next thin crack above the overhang to the left.

**Canny Ling (5)**  
the final thin crack just left of the large corner.
