The baked sandstone rock together with its quarried nature, particular on the Mollusk Wall, gives it an amenable atmosphere accompanied with the opportunity to wander off and take a dip at will. In stark contrast to this, the Tremors Wall and Cave Area, offer impressive overhanging faces which have deterred one notable nervous activist. These are intimidating routes, not to be underestimated.</p>

            <p>The cliffs as a whole dry quite quickly but can suffer from seepage on the Mollusk Wall and are not pleasant in humid weather when the crimps can feel awfully slimy.</p>
