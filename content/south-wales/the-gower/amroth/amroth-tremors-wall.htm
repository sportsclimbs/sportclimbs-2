            <p><b>1. Hullabaloo (6a) * </b>prominent left-facing groove line exiting right and up at the roof.</p>
            <p><b>2. Crest of a Wave (6c) * </b>the right arete of the groove gives a few excellent moves.</p>
            <p><b>3. Keelhaul (6b+) </b>difficult moves through the right-hand side of the overlap above the ledge via a thin crack soon relent. Trend leftwards to the belay.</p>
            <p><b>4. Plankwalk (6a+) * </b>the thin crackline springing from the right-hand side of the ledge gives a difficult entry via the overhang after which it relents for the final overhang to be gained. An airy pull and long reach gains the belay above it.</p>
            <p><b>5. The Rickter Scale (6b) * </b>the next crackline to the right gaining it from the last route has a harder move through the overlap via the groove. Above, again it relents, and the final overhang proves slightly easier than its neighbour.</p>
            <p><b>6. Project </b>the tiered overlaps to the right gained from the left-hand side of the next ledge system.</p>
            <p>The next routes start below the main section of overlapping wall from some convenient ledge systems. These can be gained easily at low tide and at mid-tide can be traversed to from the ledges below the last group of routes: not a good idea on an incoming tide. </p>
            <p><b>7. Tremors (6c) * </b>the left-hand line piercing the overlaps to the right of a huge perched block has an easy start and short tricky section through the tiered roofs. The belay lies in the box-shaped recess at the top of the crag.</p>
            <p><b>8. Dead Man's Shoes (7a) ** </b>tackles the lower tiered overlaps from a shallow groove to a sandy ledge. The tiered overlaps above provide sustained moves to gain a respite below the final bulge. This is tackles 2m right of the bolt via good holds and a swing back left to the belay.</p>
            <p><b>9. Spectre of Love (6c+) ***</b> A magnificent route. Tackle the roofs above the next groove line and continue direct through the twin overlaps to gain a thin crack system leading to the capping overhang. This is overcome by an easy long reach or a jamming crack, take you pick.</p>
