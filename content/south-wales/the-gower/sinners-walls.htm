            <p>Situated about 200m further on than Black Wall right, this bay of rock is easily reached by the obvious fisherman's path: it lies about 200m before the building atop the cliffs. It has a handful of good little routes.</p>

            <p> <b>1. Devil May Care (6c+) </b> the left wall via some very long moves. </p>
            <p> <b>2. Transgressor's Groove (5) </b>the slabby corner has a short tricky section </p>
            <p> <b>3. Butcher's Slab (6a) </b>the slabby wall with a tricky finale </p>
            <p> <b>4. RepentanceArete (6b+) </b>the right-hand side of the arete gained from the corner on the right </p>
            <p> <b>5. Stepped Corner (6b) </b>just that and awkward </p>
            <p> <b>6. Sin Bin (6b) </b>the arete, mantelshelf and face with a long reach to the belay </p>
            <p> <b>Scintillate (6a+) </b>the obvious flake to join Sin Bin at the ledge. </p>
            <p> <b>Forgiveness (6b) </b>huge clacite crystal lead to a steep flake and joining Sin Bin after roof. </p>
            <p> <b>7. Father</b> <b> Confessor (6b) </b>the pillar/arete to a horrible finish </p>
            <p> <b>Sin fear (4+) </b>Corner crack, nice bridging. Belay can be gained WITHOUT USE OF LARGE JAMMED BLOCKS IN CHIMNEY. </p>
            <p> <b>8. Sinbad (6b) </b> the stepped roof with a balancy section on the slab </p>
            <p> <b>9. Sinus (6b) </b>another of the same with a hard start </p>
            <p> <b>10. Synthesizer Slab (6b) *</b> the lovely delicate slab </p>
            <p> <b>Devilment (4) </b>Short arete leading to pleasant stepped groove.<b><br> </b> </p>
            <p> <b>11. For ye who has sinned.... (6c) </b>left-hand side of the lower wall with a hard move to finish </p>
            <p> <b>The Seven Deadly Sins (6c+) * </b>line between the two after first bolt of Wages. Use belay on left. </p>
            <p> <b>12. Wages of Sin (6c+) * </b>short intense wall with two difficult sections. </p>
            <p> <b>13. The Sinner Man (7b) </b>a desperate sequence on small slots and a rounded finale. Harder for the short. </p>
