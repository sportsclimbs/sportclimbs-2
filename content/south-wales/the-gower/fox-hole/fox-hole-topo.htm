            <h3>The Routes</h3>
            <p>The crag forms a large cave towards its left-hand side, the first routes being on the prominent grey pillar.</p>

            <p><b>1. Unlikely Alliance (6b) &starf;</b> steep open climbing. A good warm up..</p>
            <p><b>2. Connard Canard (7b) &starf;</b> very steep line up a grey streak. Two hard moves compliant on a long reach and a strong left arm. </p>
            <p><b>3. Goose 'n Lucy (6c+) &starf;&starf;</b> magnificent jug pulling up the right-hand side of the pillar, almost in the cave. A hard start and complex finish.</p>
            <p><b>4. Pioneers of the Hypnotic Groove (7b) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> brilliant sustained climbing up the groove at the back of the cave. One badly placed bolt and lots of effort required.</p>
            <p><b>5. Palace of Swords Reversed (8a) &starf;&starf;</b> powerful. Two very vicious moves on the alarmingly overhanging wall.</p>
            <p><b>6. Chicken Licken (6c+)</b> short, sharp shock up overhanging arete.</p>
            <p><b>7. Foxy Lady (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> magnificent trad. route soon to be bolted. Will be 7a when done Can start up the Hooker to make a more direct route. </p>
            <p><b>8. The Hooker (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> another superb sustained pitch with a sting in the tail. Move left to the belay at the top. Originally started up Joy de Viva but direct this way. </p>
            <p><b>9. Joy de Viva (7a+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> a magnificent direct pitch, sustained and fingery but still low in its respective grade. A long reach helps. </p>
            <p><b>10. Power Play (7b+) &starf;&starf;</b> a fine fingery pitch on crisp little edges and side-pulls. A long reach helps after a peculiar start. </p>
            <p><b>11. Turkey Lurking (7c) &starf;&starf;</b> leftwards exit from BR three on Power Play to the belay of Foxy Lady. Pumpy. </p>
            <p><b>12. Ducky Lucky (7a+) &starf;</b>&starf; superb climbing with a long reach or over-technical move. Still low in the grade.</p>
            <p><b>13. The Day the Sky Fell In (6b+) &starf;</b> pleasant jug-pulling warm up on fringes of wall.</p>
