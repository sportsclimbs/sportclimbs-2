Bosco’s Bosco’s A new crag in the heart of Gower with very easy access and a host of sport routes and trad. routes. It lies 300m east of Minchin Hole in a very pleasant ‘gulch’. The cliff is tidally affected save for the cave area.

## Approach

To reach the cliff follow the coast path eastwards from Southgate National Trust car park along the edge of the plateau until 100m after the cliff-top ‘chair’ (this approximately 800m beyond the car park). From here descent a small bluff and follow a diagonal path down the hillside to a prominent ‘cutout’ on the sea’s edge. At low tide you can walk easily around to the cliff’s base or at high tide it is possible to abseil in. If the tide cuts off access the only way back to the top is up the abseil descent rope: tide tables are essential for climbing here.
