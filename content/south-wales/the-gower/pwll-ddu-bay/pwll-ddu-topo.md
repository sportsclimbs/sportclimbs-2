**1. Swept Away (6a+)**  
Grubby left-hand line .

**2. Clean Up (6a)**  
Leftwards line.

**3. **Ashes to Ashes (6c) *★★*****  
Long shallow groove line.

**4. Decades Apart (6c) *★★***  
Line of cracks up leaning wall.

**5. Fort for Three E5 6b (7b) *★***  
A single very technical move with difficult clips and off-balance climbing. Fingery.

**6. Chimera (7c) *★★***  
Desperate continuation.

**7. Senser part 1 (7b+) *★★***  
Short, sharp shock treatment. Snatchy climbing for the fingery crux. 

**Senser part 2 (7c+) *★★★***  
The first claimed 8a in South East Wales but now 7c+. Sustained with a bad sixth clip. A magnificent sustained effort.

**8. Jezebel (7a+) *★★***  
An excellent introduction to the harder sport climbs. Easily up the groove with a fine, reachy finish.

**9. Crock Block (6c) *★***  
Steep and relatively juggy.

**10. Old Slapper (7a+)**  
A hideous little route with a desperate and very trying start.

Desperate snatchy climbing.

The prominent layback crack.

The groove above.

**15. Power Nap (7a)**  
Technical climbing with a single bolt belay.

**16. Snooze Control (5+)**  
Leads into a short groove high up. The groove above is dirty.

**17. Sleep Easy (7b)**  
hard high up since loss of hold.

**18. R.E.M. Sleep (5+)**  
Leads into a groove with a thread.

**19. White Slider (6a+)**  
The cleaned slab slinking rightwards.

**20. Project**

**21. Miami Vice (6b+)**  
Start from the right (6c direct) onto the slabby face.

**22. Coronal Discharge (6a+)**  
Gains a square-cut niche.

**23. Wakey Wakey (6a)**  
Deceptively difficult climbing.
