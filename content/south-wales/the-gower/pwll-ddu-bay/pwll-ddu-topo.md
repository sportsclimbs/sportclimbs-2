**1\. Swept Away (6a+)** grubby left-hand line **2\. Clean Up (6a)** leftwards line.

**3\. **Ashes to Ashes (6c) ★★**** long shallow groove line

**4\. Decades Apart (6c) ★★** line of cracks up leaning wall.

**5\. Fort for Three E5 6b (7b) ★** a single very technical move with difficult clips and off-balance climbing. Fingery.

**6\. Chimera (7c)** ★★ desperate continuation.

**7\. Senser (part 1) (7b+) ★★** short, sharp shock treatment. Snatchy climbing for the fingery crux. **Senser (7c+) ★★★** the first claimed 8a in South East Wales but now 7c+. Sustained with a bad sixth clip. A magnificent sustained effort.

**8\. Jezebel (7a+) ★★** an excellent introduction to the harder sport climbs. Easily up the groove with a fine, reachy finish.

**9\. Crock Block (6c) ★** Steep and relatively juggy.

**10\. Old Slapper (7a+)** a hideous little route with a desperate and very trying start.

**11\. Skedaddle (7a+)** desperate snatchy climbing.

**12\. The Flight of Icarus (6c) ★★** the prominent layback crack.

**13\. St Elmo's Fire (6a+)** links left across the wall from the next route.

**14\. Cat Nap (6a+)** the groove above.

**15\. Power Nap (7a)** technical climbing with a single bolt belay.

**16\. Snooze Control (5+)** leads into a short groove high up. The groove above is dirty.

**17\. Sleep Easy (7b)** hard high up since loss of hold.

**18\. R.E.M. Sleep (5+)** leads into a groove with a thread

**19\. White Slider (6a+)** the cleaned slab slinking rightwards.

**20\. Project**

**21\. Miami Vice (6b+)** Start from the right (6c direct) onto the slabby face.

**22\. Coronal Discharge (6a+)** Gains a square-cut niche

**23\. Wakey Wakey (6a)** deceptively difficult climbing

**24\. Sleep Over (5)** the final wall on the right.
