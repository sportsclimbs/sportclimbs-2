Long shallow groove line.

**4. Decades Apart (6c) *★★***

Desperate continuation.

Short, sharp shock treatment. Snatchy climbing for the fingery crux.

The first claimed 8a in South East Wales but now 7c+. Sustained with a bad sixth clip. A magnificent sustained effort.

An excellent introduction to the harder sport climbs. Easily up the groove with a fine, reachy finish.

Steep and relatively juggy.
