            <p>Another surprising find in one of the quietestcoves in Carmarthenshire. Superb rock and climbing and a very peaceable setting should combine to make this a very worthwhile venue in the fullness in time. The central section of the crag is very steep whilst on its wings lesser angled walls give more technical climbs.</p>

            <p>The rotue suffer little seepage after rain, except in prolonged periods of bad weather, the crag can be reached 2 hours after high tide and it faces north west, only gatting late after noon sun</p>


            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>Take the road from Amroth travelling east towards Pendine. After 6km the Green Bridge public house will be passed on the left-hand side of the road. 100m before this and opposite a stone circle is a right-hand turn. Take this turn down a rough unmade road which leads past a caravan park on the left to a very tranquil cove in 2km. The crag is situated on the left-hand side of this beach.</p>
