A new section of crag around to the right and beyond the tidal access point. This can be gained at low tide roughly two hours either side of low tide either from Morfa Bychan or Pendine Sands. There is another excellent section of cliff in between with a number of good routes soon to be displayed here. **Please respect any routes identified as projects as a lot of effort has gone into preparing these.**
