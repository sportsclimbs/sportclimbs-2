{.topo .w100}

**1. Jap's Eye  (6a+)**  
Easy slab culminating in crux finale.

**2. Cheesy Flaps  (5+)**  
Easiest on slab via prominent 'shotholes'.

**3. Double Dutch  (6c)**  
Hard start to small cave, then excellent slab above.

**4. Miss You  (6c) *★***  
Pleasant intro to harder slab climbing. Tricky start and finish viaright-hand side of hole.

**5. Rotbeest  (7b+) *★***  
Move left out of Wandelanden Tak to make desperate 'smeary' moves directly to the BB.

**6. Wandelanden Tak  (7a) *★★***  
A superb direct pitch with fine technical intricacies throughout.

**7. Geef Onze Fietsen Terug  (6c+, 6a+) *★★***  
A very fine two pitch route:  
**1.** The best pitch on the lower wall moving leftwards at its top to gain the BB of Wandelanden Tak.  
**2.** An excellent up pitch via the left-hand side of the prominent upper overlap. This can also be gained by a traverse from the right from the belay of Don't Gism etc.

**8. Stoeipoesje  (7a) *★★***  
More fine technical intricacies direct to a chain BB.

**9. Wij Zitten Nog  (6b+)**  
A fine little route straight up just left of a prominent thin crackline.

**10. Stinking of Fish  (6a+)**  
The straight thin crack provides an alternative start to 11

**11. Don't Gism on My Sofa  E1 5a,5c *★★***  
Another excellent two pitch route up the slab with a particularly worthwhile second pitch. The first pitch can also be used as an easy route in its own right.  
**1.** The ramp leads leftwards to a BB.  
**2.** Take the slab above, tricky 5m above, to gain the overlap. Pull through leftwards onto the superb, airy upper slab. It is possible to lower-off from the belay back to half-height or the belay on Wandelanden Tak for its top pitch.

**12. Ik Kan Mijn Ei Niet Kwejt  (7a+)**  
Superb climbing to a final difficult leftwards exit.
