            <p> <b>1. Jap's Eye</b> (6a+) Easy slab culminating in crux finale. </p>
            <p> <b>2. Cheesy Flaps</b> (5+) Easiest on slab via prominent 'shotholes'. </p>
            <p> <b>3. Double Dutch</b> (6c) Hard start to small cave, then excellent slab above. </p>
            <p> <b>4. Miss You</b> (6c) * Pleasant intro to harder slab climbing. Tricky start and finish viaright-hand side of hole.</p>
            <p> <b>5. Rotbeest</b> (7b+) * Move left out of Wandelanden Tak to make desperate 'smeary' moves directly to the BB. </p>
            <p> <b>6. Wandelanden Tak</b> (7a) ** A superb direct pitch with fine technical intricacies throughout.</p>
            <p> <b>7. Geef Onze Fietsen Terug</b> (6c+, 6a+) ** A very fine two pitch route:
                <ol>
                    <li>The best pitch on the lower wall moving leftwards at its top to gain the BB of Wandelanden Tak.</li>
                    <li> An excellent up pitch via the left-hand side of the prominent upper overlap. This can also be gained by a traverse from the right from the belay of Don't Gism etc.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p> <b>8. Stoeipoesje </b>(7a) ** More fine technical intricacies direct to a chain BB. </p>
            <p> <b>9. Wij Zitten Nog </b>(6b+) A fine little route straight up just left of a prominent thin crackline.</p>
            <p> <b>10. Stinking of Fish</b> (6a+) The straight thin crack provides an alternative start to 11</p>
            <p> <b>11. Don't Gism on My Sofa</b> E1 5a,5c ** Another excellent two pitch route up the slab with a particularly worthwhile second pitch. The first pitch can also be used as an easy route in its own right. <b>1) </b>The ramp leads leftwards to a BB. <b>2)</b> Take the slab above, tricky 5m above, to gain the overlap. Pull through leftwards onto the superb, airy upper slab. It is possible to lower-off from the belay back to half-height or the belay on Wandelanden Tak for its top pitch. </p>
            <p><b> 12. Ik Kan Mijn Ei Niet Kwejt</b> (7a+) Superb climbing to a final difficult leftwards exit.</p>
