            <p>Well you may have thought that the Gower sports-climbing section was complete but in reality it had to include this excellent little wall the majority of development upon which took place in the 80s.</p>

            <p>Originally discovered by Jeremy Talbot and use for aid practice the cliff was realised for its true potential by Andy Sharp in the early Eighties who freed a number of the original routes and added a few of his own. Developments have been sporadic since namely from Tony Forster and Roy Thomas.</p>

            <h3>What&rsquo;s the climbing like?</h3>

            <p>Steep, technical and fingery face climbing abounds on the harder routes. There are a few cracks thrown in for good measure in the lower end of the &lsquo;E&rsquo; spectrum.</p>

            <h3>When should I go there?</h3>

            <p>Tucked away under the coastal path from Rhossili to Worms Head the cliff faces in a south-westerly direction and hence dries very quickly. It is a very pleasant place to climb in the spring and autumn and especially summer evenings but a venue to avoid in hot sunny weather. It can also be useful on still winter days.</p>
            <h3>Grades</h3>

            <p>A good range but few true sport routes: E2 x 1, E3 x 2, E4 x 2, E5 x 1, 7a x 1, 7b+ x 2.</p>

            <h3>What are the choice routes?</h3>

            <p><i>The Adulteress</i> (E2) provides a good warm up for harder fair to its right. The classic line of <i>Crime and Punishment</i> (E5) is a must as are <i>Blackman&rsquo;s Pinch</i> (E4) and the superb and unremitting <i>Skull Attack</i> (7b+). For total all-out boulder problems try <i>Black Wall</i> (7b+).</p>

            <h3>Anything left for me?</h3>

            <p>In a word, no. They&rsquo;ve even beaten you to the girdle!</p>
