            <p><b>1. The Adulteress E2 5c &starf;</b> the crack, overlap, then right to wider crack. A good warm up.</p>
            <p><b>2. Blackman's Pinch E4 6b &starf;&starf;</b> the rightward slanting crack, overlap, BR, and short wall to finishing crack of Adulteress. Popular but easy in technical grade. </p>
            <p><b>3. Skull Attack (7b+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> THE route of the wall. A very technical wall and thin crack gain the roof. Step left to finish up a thin crack and groove. Fully bolted.</p>
            <p><b>Retrobution (7b) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> takes the groove of <em>Crime and Punishment</em> but follows it all the way into <em>Skull Attack</em> and finishes up that.</p>
            <p><b>4. Crime and Punishment E5 6b &starf;&starf;</b> scoop and shallow groove to its top. Step right to follow thin crack through overlap to finishing wall. </p>
            <p><b>Black Wall Direct (8a+) &starf;&starf;</b> starts up <em>Black Wall</em> but goes straight through the overhang.</p>
            <p><b>5. Black Wall (7b) &starf;&starf;</b> desperate technical climbing. A hard wall leads to an overlap followed by even harder moves. Old and new BR's mark the line.</p>
            <p><b>6. Inch Pinch E3 6b</b> hard moves gain a crack where the difficulties ease. Some PRs in place. </p>
            <p><b>7. The Hant (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> after the hard start of Inch Pinch, move right go through the overlap, tricky, and follow a shallow groove and crack. </p>
            <p><b>8. Tribulations (7a) &starf;</b> short desperate wall on right. </p>
            
            <p><b>9. Shakeout E3 &starf;</b> a worthwhile girdle traverse from right to left across the wall. </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>15m. 6a</b>. Follow the obvious rising break across the wall, PRs, to take a stance in Crime and Punishment.</li>
                <li><b>21m. 5c.</b>Move up, then continue leftward into the Adulteress to finish.</li>
            </ol>
