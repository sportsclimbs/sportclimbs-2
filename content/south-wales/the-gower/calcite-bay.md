Situated about 200m further on than Black Wall right, this bay of rock is easily reached by the obvious fisherman's path down to Sinners Wall and then working back north: it lies about 200m before the building atop the cliffs. It has a handful of good little routes. It can also be gained by traversing south from Black Wall
