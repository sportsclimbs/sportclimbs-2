Introduction
------------

The impressive upper tier has some really tough routes coupled with a number of lower grade climbs that should satisfy the masses. Relatively easy access after a pleasant walk along the cliff tops from the Mewslade car park.

Approach
--------

Follow the cliff top path eastwards from Mewlsade car park down through the fields to and a 'kissing' gate to the cliff top path proper. Follow this above Sadam's Wall and the Second Sister to another gate. One hundred meters after this gate a track leads down the broad grassy gully and the crag will be seen to you right.

Restrictions
------------

There is a huge nest on the crag which is occasionally occupied by a Raven. If so a restriction may be imposed. Please look for notices or view the BMC RAD before climbing there in the spring.
