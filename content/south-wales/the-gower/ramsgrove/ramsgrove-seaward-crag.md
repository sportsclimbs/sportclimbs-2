Introduction
------------

A good, south-facing wall with a handfull of good little routes with a tremendous outlook.

## Approach

From the parking in Mewslade - please make payment in honesty box - follow the coast path through the farm and a couple of gates before striking down via a vague seaward path to a gate atop a long gully leading down to the sea. Go through this and over the stile and continuing down the gully to the sandy beach. The cliff is back and to your right. Before you get there, there is a crag in the gully back to your left, 80m down from the stile - this has one sport route **Al-Tikrit (6b+) ★★**.

**1. Phelan Man (6b) *★***  
relatively straightforward start steepening to a technical finale to reach the belay.

A fine little route with pleasantly sustained climbing after a technical start through the starting overlap.

**3. The Peacock Guys (6b)**  
unusual climbing via a shallow groove and series of overlaps.

A pleasant exercise on jugs to a steep finale.
