## Introduction

Another surprising find with a wonderful southerly outlook and a number of excellent, though in most case unfortunately short, routes on excellent rock. The climbing is fingery and technical lower down and in most cases eases off above. The crag dries very quickly, takes very little seepage and has relative ease of access.

## Approach

From the parking in Mewslade - please make payment in honesty box - follow the coast path through the farm and a couple of gates before striking down via a vague seaward path to a gate atop a long gully leading down to the sea. Go through this and over the stile and continuing down the gully to the sandy beach. Walk left along the obvious, but in places vague, path past the two protruding buttresses Of the First and Second Sister until the long flat wall can be seen up and to the left.

The first routes are on a short wall up and to the left. An ideal winter venue.

a series of off-balance side pulls lead to an easing at the next to last bolt.

fingery moves up the wall lead to a problematic entry into a slim groove.

the bald wall, pegs since removed leads up and then into a rightwards crackline

climbs into a niche, bold, and then leftwards into the same crack as 10.

bouldery moves onto the thin wall lead to a slab the belay is above the overlap.

**13. It Stinks (6c) ★**

the wall just right, bold, then move right and up via the overhang.

the right fringe of the wall moving leftwards to a shared belay above the overhang..
