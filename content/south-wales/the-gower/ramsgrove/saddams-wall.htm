            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A good, recently redeveloped wall. North-facing but protected from the wind and with easy access for an evening or joint visit with another crack. Al Tikrit is a classic, south-facing wall with a handfull of good little routes with a tremendous outlook</p>

            <h2>Access</h2>

            <p>From the parking in Mewslade - please make payment in honesty box - follow the coast path through the farm and a couple of gates before striking down via a vague seaward path to a gate atop a long gully leading down to the sea. Go through this and over the stile and continuing down the gully for a short way (100m) before breaking out left, facing out, into a subsidiary gully where the buttress can be found.<img src="/img/south-wales/the-gower/Saddams.jpg" width="700" height="933"></p>
