## Introduction

A good, recently redeveloped wall. North-facing but protected from the wind and with easy access for an evening or joint visit with another crack. Al Tikrit is a classic, south-facing wall with a handfull of good little routes with a tremendous outlook

## Approach

From the parking in Mewslade - please make payment in honesty box - follow the coast path through the farm and a couple of gates before striking down via a vague seaward path to a gate atop a long gully leading down to the sea. Go through this and over the stile and continuing down the gully for a short way (100m) before breaking out left, facing out, into a subsidiary gully where the buttress can be found.
