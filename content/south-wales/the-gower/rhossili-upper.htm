            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><img src="/img/south-wales/the-gower/Rhos1.jpg" width="500" height="1036"></p>
            <p>A great new area of cliffs developed over the past few years with a number of worthwhile routes without the complications of tidal access and seepage. These cliffs can be climbed on all year round given the right weather conditions. They also provide a useful compliment to the lower crags when the tide is in.</p>

            <p>There are a number of cliffs with varying styles but whilst the hard routes of Trial Wall are particularly iconic, there are a significant number of easy/mid grade sport routes to sample on all of the crags.</p>

            <p>For the crags at sea-level, follow the path just above the Worms Head Arms down onto the beach and cross the beach to your chosen crag...best to check tide times beforehand.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>

            <p>From the car park at Rhossili (there is a charge) follow the track along the top of the cliffs to locate your chosen crag. From Trial Wall, there is a path that runs beneath all of the cliffs which leads up to the lookout post situated above Carbon Slabs</p>
