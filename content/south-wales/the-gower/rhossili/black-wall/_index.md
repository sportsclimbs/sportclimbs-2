This crag is gained by descending the path from the car park at Rhossilli onto the beach and turning east to gain the first prominent cove - Shipwreck Cove. Black Wall is situated 100m left of this and can be accessed up to 2 hours after high tide.

**1. Thieving Little Parasites (6a)**  
Left-hand of two lines on the angled wall on the left of the crag.

**2. Wittle Thieving Lankers (4) *★***  
The right-hand line.

**3. Fats Waller (6c+) *★***  
The slim corner is harder than it looks.

**4. The Route with Two Pockets (7b) *★***  
Easy to the steep wall with, guess what, two pockets.

**5. Black Adder (6c) *★***  
Small holds on the wall lead to a steeper finale with good holds.

**6. The Strongbow Flyer (6b)**  
A tricky start then no great thereafter.

**7. Rum Thieves (6b+) *★***  
Direct up the wall is better.
