**1. The Adulteress E2 5c *★***  
The crack, overlap, then right to wider crack. A good warm up.

**2. Blackman's Pinch E4 6b *★★***  
The rightward slanting crack, overlap, BR, and short wall to finishing crack of Adulteress. Popular but easy in technical grade.

**3. Skull Attack (7b+) *★★★***  
THE route of the wall. A very technical wall and thin crack gain the roof. Step left to finish up a thin crack and groove. Fully bolted.

**Retrobution (7b) *★★★***  
Takes the groove of _Crime and Punishment_ but follows it all the way into _Skull Attack_ and finishes up that.

**4. Crime and Punishment E5 6b *★★***  
Scoop and shallow groove to its top. Step right to follow thin crack through overlap to finishing wall.

**Black Wall Direct (8a+) *★★***  
Starts up _Black Wall_ but goes straight through the overhang.

**5. Black Wall (7b) *★★***  
Desperate technical climbing. A hard wall leads to an overlap followed by even harder moves. Old and new BR's mark the line.

**6. Inch Pinch E3 6b**  
hard moves gain a crack where the difficulties ease. Some PRs in place.

**7. The Hant (7a) *★★***  
After the hard start of Inch Pinch, move right go through the overlap, tricky, and follow a shallow groove and crack.

**8. Tribulations (7a) *★***  
Short desperate wall on right.

**9. Shakeout E3 *★***  
A worthwhile girdle traverse from right to left across the wall.  
**1.  15m. 6a** Follow the obvious rising break across the wall, PRs, to take a stance in Crime and Punishment.  Trial Wall map
**2.  21m. 5c** Move up, then continue leftward into the Adulteress to finish.
