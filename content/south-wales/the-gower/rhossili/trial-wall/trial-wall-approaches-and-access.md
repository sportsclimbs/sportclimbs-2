## Approach

From the car park at Rhossili village, follow the narrow road (private) past the National Trust shop and the coastguard cottages westwards in the direction of Worms Head. Just before the end of the road where the stone wall and cliff edge almost meet, cut down and rightwards. Once over the edge, the path passes beneath the steep Trial Wall, with another scattering ofsmaller crags in the near vicinity.
