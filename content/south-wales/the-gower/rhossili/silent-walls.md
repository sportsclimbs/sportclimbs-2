Situated about 100m further on than Black Wall right, this bay of rock is easily reached by the obvious fisherman's path: it lies about 300m before the building atop the cliffs. It has a handful of good little routes. (NB. The nearby Silent Fright Buttress is not covered here as there are only trad routes there.)

**1.Nick's Corner HVS 5a**  
The obvious corner

**2. OK Squire(6a+)**  
Excellent slab just right

**3.Freeloader's arête (6a+)**  
The right-hand side of the slab

**4.It's oh so Quiet (6b) *★***  
The arête gained from the left with a tricky start move. Add a plus for the short

**5.Noisiness (6b)**  
The unusual open groove line.

**6.Bedlam (6b)**  
A leftwards line via a technical slab and crimpy finishing wall

**7. White Noise (6c+) *★★***  
The arête taken on its left-hand side with some smart 'fridge hugging' above the overlap. Excellent and tough for the grade.
