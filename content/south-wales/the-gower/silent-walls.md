Situated about 100m further on than Black Wall right, this bay of rock is easily reached by the obvious fisherman's path: it lies about 300m before the building atop the cliffs. It has a handful of good little routes.

**1.Nick's Corner HVS 5a** the obvious corner

**2.** **OK Squire(6a+)** excellent slab just right

**3.Freeloader's Arete (6a+)** the right-hand side of the slab

**4.It's oh so Quiet (6b) ★** the arete gained from the left with a tricky start move. Add a plus for the short

**5.Noisiness (6b)** the unusual open groove line.

**6.Bedlam (6b)** a leftwards line via a technical slab and crimpy finishing wall

**7.** **White Noise (6c+) ★★** the arete taken on its left-hand side with some smart 'fridge hugging' above the overlap. Excellent and tough for the grade.
