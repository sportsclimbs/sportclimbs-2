Character
---------

The narrow ravine close to Morrisons in Buxton gives a handful of pleasant routes with extremely easy access. The rock is excellent quality but unfortunately the routes are only about 10 - 12m in height.

The crag is shady so can be good in hot weather. However it's best avoided in humid conditions.

Approach
--------

![](/img/peak/buxton/Ashwood.gif)When approaching from Buxton down the A6, after leaving the roundabout alongside Morrisons, a small layby will be seen on the right-hand side of the road in about 200m. Park here - it is worth noting that it easier to park here when approaching from the opposite direction.
{.csa}

The ravine is directly behind the parking area. The crags are about 1m walk from the car.
{.csa}

Unfortunately the first 4 routes appear to have been debolted for unknown reasaons when last checked (2021).

Layout
------

There are three main sections of wall, the first most easily identified on the left-hand side of the ravine when entering it.

The other routes are on the right-hand side of the ravine, hidden from view but easily identified when walking up the ravine.
