**1. Suck yer Thumb (6b)**  
A tricky bulge, easing above.

**2. Held her Head (6b)**  
Another tricky bulge.

**3. She didn't Ken (6b+)**  
A fine little bulge and short fingery wall.

**4. 1. J.L.N.O.E (7b+) *★***  
Short but steep and powerful crux. Low in grade. Recleaned and regeared.

**5. Much Monkey Magic (7a) *★★***  
Sustained crackline. Pumpy and a little awkward. Can be damp in humid weather. High in grade and not a warm up. Recleaned and regeared.

**6. Otto di Catania (7a+) *★★***  
Great climbing with a supercharged crux or a one-arm pull up. Recleaned and regeared.

**7. Blazed but Amazed (7b+) *★***  
You will be by the crux and even then its not all over. A very awkward to work out bulge. Recleaned, regeared and new belay added.

**8. The Philandering Sons of Magic Women (7a)**  
Powerful start, awkward crack and airy finish rights and just plain strenuous for good measure. Recleaned, regeared and new belay added.

**9. A Wild Man from Way Back When (7b) *★***  
Sustained climbing with a hard start and a reachy central section. A fine fingery climb. Recleaned, regeared and new belay added.

**10. Duelling Biceps (7a+) *★***  
A great name but out of theme, if you the theme that is. A strenuous and quite airy little pitch. Recleaned, regeared and new belay added.

**11. A Woman in Wellington (7b)**  
Very short and powerful bulge. High in grade.

**12. Wet Yer Whistle (7b+) *★***  
A very hard bulge after tricky start. Just plain strenuous.

**13. The Main Motor Mile (7a+) *★★***  
The original classic of the crag. A difficult low crux and then just army. Better since the loss of a poised block.

**14. Pingham's Route (7c+) *★★***  
Leaning wall, big roof and more to come.

**15. Laughing at the Rain (7c) *★★★***  
One of the best short routes in the Peak. A very hard start and then jugs and finger-locks to the top. Overhangs by 6metres! 


**Singing in the Rain (7b+)**  
This link up connects the start of *Mesmerized* to the upper section of *Laughing at the Rain*.

**16. Mesmerized (7b) *★★***  
The big hanging corner with a hard entry from the right. Regeared at start.

**17. You Know UFOs (7a+) *★***  
Direct from start of Mesmerized. Powerful. **The ET Extension** 
(7b+) climbs the final roof left of the UFO finish. Down aid to get the gear back.

**18. Euphoric (7a)**  
More powerful climbing but gentler above the roof.

**19. Pneumatic (6c+)**  
A powerful bulge and extending moves leftwards and up.

**20. Ecstatic (6b)**  
A difficult bulge is followed by an easy crack.

**21. Fantastic (6b)**  
A long reach to reach the juggy bulge and groove line above. Worthwhile

**22. Traumatic (6b+)**  
Slightly better with huge holds and one long pull.

**23. Check Out (6a) *★***  
An awkward bulge to jugs, crack and fine leftwards finish. Excellent.

**24. New Nomad (6b+) *★***  
A tricky little bulge and crackline to overhang.

**25. Napped a Nod (6a+)**  
poor route on right. Needs traffic.
