            <p><b>1. Suck yer Thumb (6b) </b>tricky bulge, easing above</p>
            <p><b>2. Held her Head (6b) </b>another tricky bulge.</p>
            <p><b>3. She didn't Ken (6b+) </b>a fine little bulge and short fingery wall.</p>
            <p><b>4. 1. J.L.N.O.E (7b+) *</b> Short but steep and powerful crux. Low in grade. <span class="new">Recleaned and regeared</b></p>
            <p><b>5. Much Monkey Magic (7a) **</b> Sustained crackline. Pumpy and a little awkward. Can be damp in humid weather. High in grade and not a warm up. <span class="new">Recleaned and regeared</b></p>
            <p><b>6. Otto di Catania (7a+) **</b> Great climbing with a supercharged crux or a one-arm pull up. <span class="new">Recleaned and regeared</b></p>
            <p><b>7. Blazed but Amazed (7b+) *</b> You will be by the crux and even then its not all over. A very awkward to work out bulge. <span class="new">Recleaned, regeared and new belay added.</span></p>
            <p><b>8. The Philandering Sons of Magic Women (7a) </b>Powerful start, awkward crack and airy finish rights and just plain strenuous for good measure. <span class="new">Recleaned, regeared and new belay added.</span></p>
            <p><b>9. A Wild Man from Way Back When (7b) *</b> Sustained climbing with a hard start and a reachy central section. A fine fingery climb. <span class="new">Recleaned, regeared and new belay added.</span></p>
            <p><b>10. Duelling Biceps (7a+) * </b>A great name but out of theme, if you the theme that is. A strenuous and quite airy little pitch. <span class="new">Recleaned, regeared and new belay added.</span></p>
            <p><b>11. A Woman in Wellington (7b)</b> Very short and powerful bulge. High in grade. </p>
            <p><b>12. Wet Yer Whistle (7b+) * </b>Very hard bulge after tricky start. Just plain strenuous. </p>

            <p><b>13. The Main Motor Mile (7a+) **</b> The original classic of the crag. A difficult low crux and then just army. Better since the loss of a poised block.</p>
            <p><b>14. Pingham's Route (7c+) **</b> Leaning wall, big roof and more to come.</p>
            <p><b>15. Laughing at the Rain (7c) ***</b> One of the best short routes in the Peak. A very hard start and then jugs and finger-locks to the top. Overhangs 6m. <b>Singing in the Rain (7b+)</b> connect the start of Mesmerized with the upper section of Laughing at the Rain.</p>
            <p><b>16. Mesmerized (7b) **</b> The big hanging corner with a hard entry from the right. <span class="new">Regeared at start.</span> </p>
            <p><b>17. You Know UFOs (7a+) *</b> Direct from start of Mesmerized. Powerful. <b>The ET Extension </b>(7b+) climbs the final roof left of the UFO finish. Down aid to get the gear back.</p>
            <p><b>18. Euphoric (7a) </b>More powerful climbing but gentler above the roof.</p>
            <p><b>19. Pneumatic (6c+) </b>powerful bulge and extending moves leftwards and up.</p>
            <p><b>20. Ecstatic (6b) </b>difficult bulge to easy crack.</p>
            <p><b>21. Fantastic (6b) </b>long reach to juggy bulge and groove line. Worthwhile</p>
            <p><b>22. Traumatic (6b+) </b>slightly better with huge holds and one long pull.</p>
            <p><b>23. Check Out (6a) * </b>awkward bulge to jugs, crack and fine leftwards finish. Excellent.</p>
            <p><b>24. New Nomad (6b+) </b>* tricky little bulge and crackline to overhang.</p>
            <p><b>25. Napped a Nod (6a+) </b>poor route on right. Needs traffic.</p>
