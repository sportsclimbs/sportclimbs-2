## The climbing

There are 7 bolted lines all located on the first 2 viaduct pillars.

**1. This is not Cheedale (6b)**  
The far wall of the first pillar. Using either arête reduces the difficulty slightly.

**2. Welcome to Portland (Oregon) (6c) *&starf;***  
Climbs the wall R of the arete up to the big square hole. Using the arête reduces the grade to 6b.

**3. Evolution or Outrage (6c) *&starf;***  
The next line right has become easier since the appearance of a jug in the mortar.

**4. Have you ever been up Everest, Mister (6c)**  
This face features a high first bolt. Using the L arête reduces the grade to 6b+ while using the R arete reduces the grade to 6a.

The next routes climb the second pillar starting from the stone wall. The routes here can be sandy in their upper halves, something said to be worse after rain.

**5. Yeah, Whatever (6a+)**  
The left arête of the second pillar.

**6. Come Down this Instant (6b)**  
Step off the wall and follow the bolts. Good climbing when not sandy.

**7. My Plan for World Domination (6b+)**  
Fall across the gap onto the pillar and follow good holds to harder climbing higher up. Again good climbing if not too sandy.
