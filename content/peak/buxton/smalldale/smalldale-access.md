## Approach

### From Buxton

Take the A6 north out of Buxton, or south from Dove Holes, and take a right turn for Peak Dale, 1 mile after the golf Course or 1 mile on the left out of Dove Holes. The road leads through Batham Gate and Peak Dale and just before the village of Smalldale the quarry will be seen on the right-hand side of the road.

### From Stoney Middleton

From the Stoney Middleton follow the A623 to Peak Forest and after 8 miles turn L on the road signposted for Smalldale. Pass through the village and shortly after park in the first drive into the lorry park on the left.

### Parking and Access

There are two drives on the right leading into the quarry. Park in the more northern of these, ie. the second if aproaching from the south. Park just off drive on the right so as to not block access.

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT WALK THROUGH THE LORRY PARK.** Instead walk down the road to the other entrance and hop over the small stone wall. Go through an old black gate into the woods and follow the vague path to come out at *Going Straight Wall* (about 5 minutes).

## Layout

![Smalldale layout](/img/peak/buxton/small6.gif) The quarry is relatively un-complex. The main white wall is obvious by its white leaning nature and seemed with a number of thin cracks and grooves. The left wall of this leads up the hillside and gives a number of face climbs. 100m to the right of the main wall is a long line of cliffs with a mixture of traditional and sport climbs alike: only these latter routes are currently described, the trad. routes remaining in a poor state of repair.
