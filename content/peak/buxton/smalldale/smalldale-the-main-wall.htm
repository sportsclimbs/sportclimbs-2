            <p><b>1. Reservoir Frogs (6c+) &starf;&starf;</b> a fine long climb up slim side wall of buttress. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>2. First Offense (6c+) &starf;&starf;</b> the left arete of the wall gives an excellent sustained exercise. Surprisingly balancy. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>3. When Reason Sleeps (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> hard start right of the arete then bold face directly above overlap. Fine. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>4. Stainsby Girls (7b) &starf;</b> straight up from a wide crack into awkward finishing groove. Tough. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>5. Virtual Insanity (7b) &starf;&starf;</b> superb fingery face leads onto flake and tricky finale. Very fine. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>6. Soft Centre (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> the central shallow groove line and upper thin crack. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>7. Lies and Deception (7a) &starf;</b> an excellent lower wall, tough bulge and fingery moves to gain the final groove. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>8. Summat Outanowt (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> long slim groove, difficult overlap and fine headwall. A surprising find. <span class="new">Rebolted</p>
            <p><b>9. Lost Contact (7a+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> the shallow groove and thin crack in the headwall. Superb, but spaced bolts at top. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>10. Soggy Biscuits (7b+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> perhaps the route of the wall aiming for the high upper pillar. Brilliant. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>11. Can Boys (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> a fine bold pitch taking the flat face to the right. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>12. Can't Girls? (6c+) &starf;</b> pleasant face climbing with a tricky finale on the compact headwall. <span class="new">Rebolted</p>
            <p><b>13. Bedlam (6c+)</b> &starf; bold open face to right. Good climbing now cleaned. <span class="new">REBOLTED</span></p>
            <p><b>14. Noisy Neighbours (7a)</b> squeezed onto the face to the right. Some hard and fingery moves but short-lived.</p>
