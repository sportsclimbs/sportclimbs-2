This is the usually first area you reach when walking through the woods and is the most popular area at Smalldale with a number of fine routes especially the mid 6's. The wall has few strong natural features so locating the routes can be tricky at first sight. The most obvious feature is the square cut miner's shaft entrance. Route number 9, *More Chattery Teeth* climbs straight above this.
