This covers the crags up to the left of Main Wall including the routes on the left side of the Main Wall buttress.

## Bosch Wall

![Smalldale topo 3](/img/peak/buxton/smalldale-bosch-wall.jpg)
{.topo}

On the upper left-hand side of the walls are four short but worthwhile routes.
{.csa}

**1. Bish, Bash, Bosch (6b)**  
One hard move.

**2. Bolt 45 (6a+)**  
Feels more like an E2 5b!

**3. Bosch Spice (6a+)**  
More like an E3 5b!

**4. Eight till Late (6a)**  
Quite pleasant.


## Six Bee Walls

The Six Bee walls are notable for their total absence of 6b's. More short routes for the connoisseur that shouldn't be underestimated.

![Smalldale topo 3](/img/peak/buxton/smalldale-six-bee-wall.jpg)
{.topo}

**1. Beastiality (6a)**  
The furthest left up a detached pillar of rock.

**2. Killer Bee (6c) *★***  
The best of the bunch here.

**3. The Ladybird Killers (6c+)**

**4. Six Bee or Not Six Bee? (6c+)**  
Presumably not! Quite technical.

**5. Bee Movie (6a+)**

**6. To Bee a Star (6a)**  
Pleasant wall with steep finish.

**7. Terry and June (6c)**  
On the first topo! Wall to technical finish in thin crack.

The corner to the right is **Play it Again Sam (HVS 5a)**.

## Obelix Walls

![Smalldale side wall topo 3](/img/peak/buxton/smalldale-side-wall.jpg)
{.topo}

These are just to the left of the Main Wall after it turns from the arête of *First Offence* (which is 6c+).
{.csa}

**8. Tawk the Squawk (7a)**  
On the second topo. Left-hand side of arête.

**9.. Squawkietawkie (7a)**  
Hanging arête with hard start through roofs.

**10. Can'tgetmyfix (6c+)**  
Thin crack and arête.

**11. Obelix (7b) *★***  
Centre of fine tower with intricate fingery finish. 
{.rebolted}

**12. Getafix (7b) *★***  
The right arête of tower is bold and fine. 
{.rebolted}

**13. Play it Again Sam HVS 5a**
The obvious corner line right of the arête.

**14. Reservoir Frogs (6c+) *★★***  
A fine climb directly up the centre of the slim wall between the corner and the arête. Hard to read and with some committing moves near the top.
