This the front face of the fine buttress a couple of hundred metres to the left or east of Crystal Wall. The routes start from a narrow grassy ledge at the base of the wall. There is usually an in situ rope linking the belay bolts at the bottom to make access easier and safer.

**1. Reservoir Frogs (6c+) *★★***  
A fine climb directly up the centre of the slim wall between the corner and the arete. Hard to read and with some committing moves near the top.

**2. First Offense (6c+) *★★***  
The left arete of the wall gives an excellent sustained exercise. Surprisingly balancy. 

**3. When Reason Sleeps (7a+) *★★***  
Start just right of the arete and climb the face via an overlap.

**4. Stainsby Girls (7a+) *★★***  
Straight up via the obvious wide crack into awkward finishing groove. Tough. 

**5. Virtual Insanity (7b) *★★***  
Superb fingery face leads onto flake and tricky finale. 

**6. Soft Centre (7a+) *★★***  
The central shallow groove line and upper thin crack. 

**7. Lies and Deception (7a) *★***  
An excellent lower wall, tough bulge and fingery moves to gain the final groove. 

**8. Summat Outanowt (7a) *★★***  
The long slim groove, difficult overlap and fine headwall. A surprising find. 

**9. Lost Contact (7a+) *★★★***  
The shallow groove and thin crack in the headwall. Superb. 

**10. Soggy Biscuits (7b+) *★★***  
Probably the hardest on the wall aiming for the high upper pillar. Low in the grade. 

**11. Can Boys (7a) *★★***  
A fine bold pitch taking the flat face to the right. 

**12. Can't Girls? (6c+) *★***  
Pleasant face climbing with a tricky finale on the compact headwall. 

**13. Bedlam (6c+) *★***  
The bold open face to right. Good climbing. 

**14. Noisy Neighbours (7a)**  
Squeezed onto the face to the right. Some hard and fingery moves but short-lived.
