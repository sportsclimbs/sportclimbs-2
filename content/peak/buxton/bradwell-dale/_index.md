## Introduction

The quarry is situated just south of Bradwell on the right-hand side of the road when travelling up the dale from Bradwell towards Tideswell. The main quarry gets the sun for the most part of the day although the 'bottle bay' routes stay in the shade all day. Thanks to Paul Freeman.

## Access

Due to limited parking, it is best to park on the outskirts of the village and walk up the dale to the crags. After 400m up the road from the village pass by a wall on the left side of the road (I Scream E7 6b) and look for a stone wall set back and up, on the right side of the road. Walk alongside this which leads to the rocks in 1 minute. The first crag is the lower tier. Continue along the path to get to the upper tier. The Ivy League and Open Book Bay are a little further on than the lower tier routes.

The crags and routes are all described from left to right.
