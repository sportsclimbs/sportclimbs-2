            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <P>A new crag has been developed in the quarry above Castleton. It gives around 20 routes, mostly in the lower grades in a tranquil setting but with the usual quarry provisos: it still relatively new and may still be a little dusty or fragile. </P>

            <P>There are a batch of walls, all facing north west and getting little sunshine except in an evening. They dry reasonably quickly but some routes do take seepage in winter.</P>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <P>This is a little tricky. From the Tideswell crossroads on the A623 turn right when coming from Stoney Middleton and turn immediately left in front of the Anchor public house. Follow this road through a dip and take a left turn at a very prominent blue sign. Continue around in a large loop, there is a large active quarry on your right, and down the hillside until a right turn down a dirt track can be seen opposite a 'reservation' area (it is exactly 5 miles from the Anchor pub to this point). Park at the end of the track (200m) and descend the rocky track on the left into the quarry in 5 minutes - this is a very popular mountain bike track.</P>
            <P>No access has been granted so if asked to leave please do so courteously.</P>

            <h2>Lower Tier - The Pinnacle</h2>

            <P>This is situated at the far left-hand end of the quarry:</P>
