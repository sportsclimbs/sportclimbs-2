## About

This area covers all the odd crags west of Stoney Valley and north of the Wye Valley (Cheedale, Miller's Dale and Water Cum Jolly). There's a mixture of different styles of climbing here from the the short, steep and burly Cowdale to the technical face climbing of Devonshire Buttress. Many of the crags are old quarries but that doesn't necessarily mean poor quality rock. Smalldale and the best bits of Harpur Hill are as good a quality limestone as anywhere in the Peak. The only thing missing is harder routes. Currently the routes only go up 7c+ and there's only a couple of those (at Deep Dale and Cowdale).
