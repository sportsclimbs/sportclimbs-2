            <p>The cliff is easily gained by the track running alongside the quarry entrance to Topley Pike quarry from the pay and display car park to Chee Dale: take a tip, park on the opposite side of the road, its free. </p>

            <p>The cliff dries quickly, takes hardly any seepage and gets the sunshine for most of the day. A good evening or
                short day visit crag with 5 sport routes:</p>

            <h2>The Thirst House Cave</h2>

            <p>An impressive cave in the centre of the dale with just three sport routes at the moment. This is a very steep venue which is best combined with one of the other crags in the upper half of the dale.</p>
