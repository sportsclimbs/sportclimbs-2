Bear Wall
---------

A great little find with a handful of very worthwhile little pitches. The face dries in about mid April, can suffer a little seepage after rain and can also be plagued by midges in humid weather. Put off now are you well don't be, it provides great face climbing on a spring or summer evening.

## Secret Garden Crag {.mt2}

The new routes on this little crag were a welcome and surprising discovery in a very tranquil setting. Certainly worth a visit and can be combined with any of the other crags in the upper half of the dale.
