The cliff is easily gained by the track running alongside the quarry entrance to Topley Pike quarry from the pay and display car park to Chee Dale: take a tip, park on the opposite side of the road, its free.

The cliff dries quickly, takes hardly any seepage and gets the sunshine for most of the day. A good evening or short day visit crag with 5 sport routes:

A short technical desperate.

**2\. The Beast (7b+) *★***  
The best route with a short section of power.

**3\. The English Impatient (7b) *★***  
Powerful climbing on undercuts and pockets.

**4\. Instrumentally Yours (7a)**  
The front face of pillar.

**5\. Thunder Wall E3 6a**  
The thin crackline with bulge.

**6\. The Edge of Donnybrooks (7a**)  
An arete with difficult initial overlap.

The Thirst House Cave
---------------------

An impressive cave in the centre of the dale with just three sport routes at the moment. This is a very steep venue which is best combined with one of the other crags in the upper half of the dale.
