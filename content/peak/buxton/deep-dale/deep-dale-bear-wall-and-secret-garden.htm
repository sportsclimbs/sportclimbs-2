            <h2>Bear Wall</h2>


            <p>A great little find with a handful of very worthwhile little pitches. The face dries in about mid April, can suffer a little seepage after rain and can also be plagued by midges in humid weather. Put off now are you well don't be, it provides great face climbing on a spring or summer evening</p>

            <p><img src="/img/peak/buxton/Bear.jpg" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="279"><b>1. The Bear Necessities (7a) * </b>Technical bulge and blind crux.</p>
            <p><b>2. Bear Faced Cheek (7a+) *</b> Further small holds and hard moves.</p>
            <p><b>3. Bear it All (7a+) *</b> The most technical of the three.</p>
            <p><b>4. Bearly (5+) *</b> Wall and fine crack. </p>
            <p><b>5. Bearing All (6b+) </b> Technical wall and hanging flake.</p>
            <p><b>6. The Water Method Man E3 5c</b> Tricky start and pleasant crack.</p>
            <p><b>7. Setting Free the Bears E4 6a</b> Same start, right-hand side of smooth wall.</p>
            <p><b>8. Palestine (6c)</b> Short lower wall and pillar.</p>
            <p>100m to the left are two isolated routes: <b>Lariam</b> (7a) * a blunt rib and then <b>Get it Wired</b> (7a) a thin crack.</p>

            <h2>Secret Garden Crag</h2>


            <p>The new routes on this little crag were a welcome and surprising discovery in a very tranquil setting. Certainly worth a visit and can be combined with any of the other crags in the upper half of the dale.</p>

            <p><img src="/img/peak/buxton/deepsg.gif" width="461" height="229"><b>1. Costa del Soul (6c+)</b> Short difficult bulge.</p>
            <p><b>2. Mosquito Coast (6c+)</b> More of the same just right. No BRs at present.</p>
            <p><b>3. The Birdcage (7a+) * </b>Left-hand side of smart wall. </p>
            <p><b>4. Valley of the Birds (7b) **</b> Right-hand side of wall. Fine climbing. </p>
            <p><b>5. Quiet, Shhh, Hush (7a)</b> Fingery and technical though short.</p>
            <p><b>6. Secret Agenda (6c) *</b> A fine sustained route. Lower from tree.</p>
            <p><b>7. Pillar Torque (6b)</b> Obvious by name at end of wall.</p>
