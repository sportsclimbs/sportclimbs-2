## Access

Technically climbing is not allowed though it is hoped this will change in the near future. If asked to leave please do so politely. 

## Approach

![Blackwell Halt approach map](/img/peak/buxton/blamap.gif) From the upper end of the Topley Pike upper car park, go through the little gate and follow the path to the bottom of the hill. Cross over the old railway track (Monsal Trail) down to a private carpark. Go over a footbridge to some white cottages and turn left alongside the river. Go past a pump house on the right and through a short tunnel. Turn R then L and up some stone steps into the meadow above. Follow the path leftwards to the base of the crag.

## Conditions

The walls dry relatively quickly in the spring months and stay dry in relatively light rain. They get the rays of the sun until about 3pm but can become midgy on a summer's evening or in humid weather.
