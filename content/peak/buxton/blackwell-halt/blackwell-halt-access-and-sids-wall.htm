            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p><img src="/img/peak/buxton/blamap.gif" width="375" height="246">From the Topley Pike upper car park, walk down the hill and onto the railway track at its foot (the approach into Chee Dale). Turn left and through a gate and onto the live
                railway track. Cross this immediately and over a small rise into the quarry. The main wall and the side (Sid's) Wall are obvious.</p>

            <h3>Conditions</h3>

            <p>The walls dry relatively quickly in the spring months and stay dry in relatively light rain. They get the rays of the sun until about 3pm but can become midgy on a summer's evening or in humid weather.</p>
