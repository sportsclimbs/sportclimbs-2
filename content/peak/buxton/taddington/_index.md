![Taddington map](/img/peak/buxton/taddington-map.gif) When Nadim Siddiqui and Colin Struthers discovered this crag in the early Nineties they truly found one of the most &lsquo;roadside&rsquo; crags in the Peak District. They then went on to climb a number of excellent face routes with such gems as *Great eXpectations* (6c), *Certificate X *(7b), *Malcolm X* (7a+) and the superb *XXXX* (7b) together with a handful of easier &lsquo;warm-up&rsquo; type pitches on the left: All were done in the sports-climbing style which the blank nature of the wall demanded.

After releasing the information in one of the magazines, it was inevitable that attention would be drawn to the place and having stumbled across the face with a couple of friends one evening and after a subsequent chance encounter whilst cleaning, Gary Gibson joined forces with Nadim Siddiqui and promptly dispatched *Little Blue Lies* (7b), *Top MarX* (7a) and *Y Should I* (7b+) to complete the crags development.


### Situation

An important addition to the sports-climbing in the Peak District, this crag could not be more easily accessible. Situated overlooking the A6 just north of Bakewell its fine walls offer a series of climbs in the technical and fingery bracket, all with in-situ protection. It dries relatively quickly after rain, although it does suffer seepage in the winter, and faces East making it the ideal venue for warm weather. Its proximity to the road also makes it an ideal evening venue.

### Approach

Take the A6 out of Bakewell heading for Buxton and locate the Monsal Dale car park on the left (when approaching from Buxton it is best to locate this same car park, now on the right, and to backtrack). 400m past this car park and 200m after a bus stop will be seen a clearway sign. Park on the grass verge just before this. The crag is situated 50m up the hill on the left, overlooking the road
