This buttress is situated at the right-hand end of the lower tier facing the turquoise pool. It consists of a bay of rock with some excellent sport climbs and four long-neglected but worthwhile traditional climbs.

**a. Good Friend (6c+)** desperate boulder problem **b. Bad Friend (6b)** short wall **c. Unknown Friend (6b)** thin corner

**1. Old Fiends (6c+) &starf;**  excellent wall above problematic bulge on perfect rock. <span class="new">Rebolted</span>

**2. Carvery (6a+)**  superb calcite crack onto delicate face above. Can be dusty.

**3. The Wrong Unconquerable (6b) &starf;**  classic crackline on unusual rock to superb finale on a layback flake. &quot;It's the same as Left Unconquerable but the other way around.&quot;

**4. Fartless (7a+) &starf;**  short tricky section low down followed by hard fingery sequence on upper wall. Bouldery.

**5. Strap a Doc to Me (6c)**  the unusually fluted face on the right. Again worthwhile.
