**1. Argy Bargy (5)**  
Pleasant climbing on the left-hand side of the face.

**2. The Misfits (6a)**  
Flake, thin crack and short headwall. Gold BRs.

**3. Hissing Sid (6b) *★***  
Wall via small overhang and easier wall above.

**4. Slippery Bill HVS 5a**  
The orange crack/groove line finishing straight up from ledge.

**5. Ratline (7b) *★★***  
The thin crackline just left of *Cairn* is actually more of a face climb. Sequency, strenuous, superb and on excellent rock.

**6. Cairn (7a) *★★★***  
Hard moves gain the striking rounded, right facing runnel feature. From the top of this break out left onto the face from the third BR. A pre-placed long draw on the second bolt is helpful. Superb climbing on immaculate natural limestone.

**7. Stealth (7a) *★★***  
Breaks out rightwards from *Cairn* to go direct to the prominent chain belay.

**8. Orca (6c)**  
Direct through the overlap to join *Great White*.

Slabby wall above overhang.

**10. The Naked Spur(4+) *★***  
very pleasant sharp arête.

**11. Assault and Battery (6b+)**  
Short technical wall tucked in alcove. Gold BRs.

**Ground and Pound (6a)**  
The wide corner crack swing right into Trial and then moving up the thin crack before exiting left to its belay

**12. Trial and Error (7a) *★***  
The short arête packs in an interesting variety of gritstone-esque moves and is best avoided on hot days. The route has now been extended to the full height of the cliff with the belay higher than is marked.

**13. Senile Delinquents (5+)**  
Flake and wide crack via roof.

**14. Cabin Fever (6b)**  
Crack, roof and short wall to shared belay

The first of 5 lines on the small buttress.

**Wilmer (5)**  
Takes second bolt line, just R of the crack.

**16. Fred Flintstone (5) *★***  
Left-hand side of short wall with peculiar 'worm' feature.

**17. Barney Rubble (5)**  
Crack direct.

**18. Yabba Dabba Doo (4)**
