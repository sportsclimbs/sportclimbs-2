**It has to End Somewhere (6a)**  
Slab trending leftwards to lower off.

**1. DNE (4)**  
Pillar with a mantelshelf finale

**Endamol (5)**  
Central pillar past the spike of Beelzebub, which is solid!

**2. Will it Never End (4+)**  
The left pillar.

**Is this the End? (5)**  
The central wall.

Slim pillar. Pleasant though short.

**4. End Games HVS 5a**  
Climbs the crackline on the right wall of pillar.

**5. Rawlinson End (5)**  
Worthwhile climbing up the wall to the shared belay.

**6. In My Darkest Hour (5)**  
Left-hand side of face. Pleasant.

**7. Endsville (6a)**  
Front face with tricky finish.

**8. Centreville (6a+)**  
Crack to layback flake and lower off above.

**13. Parting of the Lips (5)**

**14. Ear to Ear (6a)**  
Slim wall with tricky move at half height. Worthwhile.

**15. Uncreased (VS 4c)**

**16. The Mouth Waters (6b+)**

**17. I'm a Port Vale Dribbler (6a)**  
Slim pillar.

**18. George Stark Calling (6a+) *★***  
The sharp arête on right side of the bay provides unusual climbing on excellent rock.

**19. Metal Back Crack (HVS 5a)**

**20. Stark Disbelief (6c+)**  
Climbs the centre of blank looking slab on small, hard to find, crozzlies that mostly face the wrong way. Cools temps and good skin are prerequisites. Jingus.

**21. Taking Stock (5+)**  
Also known as **Dark Lines**. Climbs the huge, curving flake crack in the upper half. Start below two thin cracks. Climb up these, move left the the foot of the big flake and follow this more easily to finish up the previous route.

**22. The Dark Half (6b+) *★***  
The right arête of the buttress provides good climbing. Care needed on the upper half as a fall could result in hitting the halfway ledge.

**23. Graveyard Blues (6a+)**  
The next arête to the right is hardest in the middle. 

**24. In Stark Contrast (6b+) *★***  
Climbs up the left side of the wall.

**26. Totally Stark (6b+)**  
The next line of bolts to the same belay.
