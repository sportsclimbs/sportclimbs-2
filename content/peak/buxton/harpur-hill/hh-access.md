### From the industrial estate

From the centre of Harpur Hill take the Grin Low Road westwards out of the village. After about 100m turn left towards the industrial estate. Follow the road around and into the industrial estate. After a sharp right bend go past Swain's go kart track on the right to a couple of parking places on the left just before a bus stop shelter. Walk back down the road to the bend and go straight on here along a track. After a hundred metres or so head up the the right and follow along until the lower tier crags are visible and head towards these. Keeping to the right past these leads to the Cairn sector or the steep path up to the upper tier.

### From the village

Park in the village on Grin Low Road, just off Harpur Hill Road, by the cemetary. On the south side of the road a path leads up just to the right of The Parks Inn. At a gravel track either go right for the crags on the western side. After 100m go up left and follow tracks leading to the west side of the lower tier and the Cairn area. Alternatively go left on the gravel track until it's possible to cross a fence on the right and follow a track to College Buttress.



### From Hillhead Lane

When heading from Miller's Dale or the A6 take the A5270 until this ends at the A515. Turn right then immediately left then immediatly right onto Brierlow Road.

Go under a railway bridge and take the first left into Hillhead Lane.

Park at the top of this lane (limited parking) alongside a bridle path. Climb over the first stile and the next and follow the bridle path for 250m. (This bridle path can also be reached by parking alongside a derelict brown brick building on the right­hand side of Hillhead Road and following a path through a gate.) Go through the first gate on the left and up the hill to the bridle path.

Follow this along through two metal gates with the quarry on your left­hand side. 250m after the second gate climb over the fence on your left to enter the quarry alongside the infamous blue lagoon (now actually a muddy brown!) Directly ahead lies Long Wall. Continuing left will lead to Pool Wall, itself usually identifiable by a smaller pool at its base.

Continuing on towards the far corner of the quarry takes you past Racetrack area routes. Returning back to Long wall, 150m beyond in the corner of the quarry will be found College Buttress.

To get to the upper tier plateau climb up the short face just beyond the end of Long Wall. The first buttress in front of you is Perchsed Block Buttress. Going left takes you to the Dark Side, while right takes you to Papacy Buttress,  the Exclusion and Prophecy sectors.
