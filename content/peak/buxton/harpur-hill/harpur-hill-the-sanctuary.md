## Left side

From below the right-hand end of Cairn Sector (Breakfast at Safeways etc.) drop down below the concrete posts and turn left to reach this pleasant face. The Sancturary features some of the best quality rock for easy sport climbing in the Peak District. Towards its left-hand side are four relatively short routes.
