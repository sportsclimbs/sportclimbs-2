            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <div class="access"><img src="/img/peak/buxton/harmap2.gif"></div>

            <p>A small road links the A515 Buxton to Ashbourne Road with the A53 Leek to Buxton road just before Rock Bay garage. This road takes you through the village of Harpur Hill and provides the best access to the cliff. From this road there are two ways into the quarry. Either park at the working men's club and strike straight up the hillside to a fence. Skirt this to the right and then back left into the lower tier of the quarry, access to the upper tier is then via a small path branching back left from the left-hand side of Cairn Sector. </p>

            <p>
                <!-- img src="../../../img/peak/buxton/harmap1.gif" width="516" height="298" -->The alternative approach is via Harpur Hill Industrial Estate: take the road past the Working Men's Club on your left and take the first turn left after this. Follow this for 400m and take a left turn into the industrial estate (this point can also be accessed from Burbage). <b>Do not park in the area by the orange gates, this is private,</b> but by Mansfield's garage or in a lay-by on the road. Follow the obvious track beyond the orange gates to a collapsed gate and through into the lower part of the quarry. Cairn Sector lies over to the right and the upper tier is best gained by a small path rising from the left-hand side of this area (10 minutes).</p>
