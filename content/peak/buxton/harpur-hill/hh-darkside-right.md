Slabby and technical wall to blocky rib.

**3. Ken Dodd's Dad's Dog's Dead (HVS 5b)**  
Crack to belay of Gathering Darkness.

**4. Gathering Darkness (6c+)**  
Start below a shelf down and left of the first bolt. Gain the shelf and continue up more easily until a short traverse right gains undercuts. Reach up left then back right and up to a break. Moves lefthard gain the belay. 4 BRs.

Long route via wall and upper rib BBs on the right.

**6. Bolt Wars (6b+)**

**7. Trad Wars (HVS 5a)**  
No belay.

Starts in corner then right and up via sharp arête.

Front face then leftwards finale.

**10. Half and Half (6a)**  
obvious cleaned line finishing via slim corner.

**11. Wild Olive (6b+) *★***  
Climb up the vague groove to the excellent wall and rib above. Passing the mid height overlap directly requires a very long reach though most opt for a short detour left and then back right.

**12. Gorignak (6b) *★***  
Climb a short, right facing corner to a small roof just below the second bolt. Go over this and continue up the wall to a short finishing arête.

**13. Galaxy Quest (6a) *★***  
Long crackline and narrow sharp rib.

**14. Omega 13 (6a+) *★***  
Long route starting via crack to wall and rib.

**15. Dr Lazarus (6a+)**  
Crack and wall finishing slightly right. Short but worthwhile.
