 {.topo .w100}

**1. The Stig E2 5c**  
Pleasant face climbing via a thin crack from the left-hand side of the alcove.

**2. Stig of the Dump E1 5a**  
The thin crack from the right-hand side of the alcove and a short bold wall. Easier above the ledge.

**Emblem Embargo HVS 5a**  
The left-hand of two thin cracks in the sidewall to the headwall above obvious niche.

**Somebody's Trademark (HVS 5a)**  
The right-hand thin crack to a ledge. Finish by moving right and up via cleaner rock above.

**3. Silent Manoeuvres E4 5c *★***  
The right-hand side of the left arete of the wall gives superb technical moves with no gear but, unfortunately, the possibility for escape.

**4. Telescopic Demand E3 6a *★***  
Excellent technical climbing via the faint thin crackline 5m right of the arete uses a side runner off right and a very long reach. Finish more easily above.

**5. Swan Song E1 5b *★***  
The vague right-trending rampline and a faint crack above leads to the TD finish.

**6. Bicycle Repair Man E1 5b *★★***  
The classic of the slab. Tackle the obvious thin crack, difficult, to gain the face proper and a small ledge. Trend slightly leftwards and up to finish via an obvious short wide crack.

**7. Top Gear E5 6b *★***  
A devious eliminate with some good and very bold climbing: particularly bold at the start and hard from leaving BRM.

**8. Charas HVS 5b *★***  
The thin central crackline of the slab. The battle with the tree is awkward and the central section of the crack difficult.

**9. Mozaic Piece E4 5c *★***  
Move right out of Charas above the tree to climb the unprotected face. Even more unprotected is the direct start at E4 5c.

**10. Wipe Out E2 5b *★★***  
A faint crack above a ledge leads to holds trending leftwards into a tiny groove and bold moves soon easing. The direct start makes it E4 5c.

**11. Paraplege E3 5c *★***  
From the start of Wipe Out continue straight up the slab via a thin crackline to a hollow finish on the headwall.

**12. Amaratarusa VS 4c**  
The slim corner line bounding the right-hand side of the wall with the small overlap providing the difficulties.

**13. Titanic Reaction HVS 5a**  
The cracks in the obvious tower give a good route when clean.

**14. Insidious Iceberg VS 4c**  
The wide crack and corner above.

**15. Down She Goes E3 5c**  
The right arete, bold, and easier cracks above.
