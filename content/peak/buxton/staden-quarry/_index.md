Staden Quarry is one of the surprises of the Peak, especially by the normal standard of its quarries. Three excellent pristine walls of grey limestone mixed with a very welcome atmosphere give three walls of superb climbing. Technique and a little boldness in places provides a venue for excellent climbs throughout with a variety of protection required and only the occasional use of in-situ gear.
