            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p><img src="/img/peak/buxton/cowmap1.gif" WIDTH="461" HEIGHT="340"><img src="/img/peak/buxton/STADEN.gif" style="clear:right" WIDTH="402" HEIGHT="340">The quarry is situated to the east of Buxton close to the small village of Cowdale which is best reached via a minor road either off the A6 or A515 one mile to the east of Buxton. Once reached, park in a good area close to some garages at the top of a steep hill with some sharp bends. From here a good path leads easily into the quarry. Please park with consideration for the local villagers.</p>


            <h3>Layout</h3>

            <p>This is a large grassy floored quarried with three exceptionally good walls on very compact limestone. The walls all face north and can be cold and damp in the winter months but superb on warm days. Beware of midges in humid weather.</p>
