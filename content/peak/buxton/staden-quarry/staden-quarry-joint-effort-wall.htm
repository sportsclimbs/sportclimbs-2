            <p><b>Hell Driver HVS 4c </b>thin crack up left-hand side of slabs to wide crack finish</p>
            <p><b> Traffic Cops E2 5b </b>bold slab to the right direct to high corner system and cracks above. Bold.</p>
            <p><b>Fiat HVS 5a </b>thin crack left of flake direct to angled overlap. Traverse right under this, PR, and finish via Suscipiat</p>
            <p><b>Herald Vitesse E1 5b ** </b>straight up steep wall, PR to gain cleaned ledge. Climb the centre of the face above via a faint crack, cross the overlap and finish via a Sycamore sapling. </p>
            <p><b>1. Xenophobia E1 5a </b>the left-hand arete of the wall starting via a flake on its left-hand side. Bold and sadly neglected.</p>
            <p><b>2. Suscipiat VS 4c * </b>the left edge of the wall leads steeply to fluted cracks and easier climbing slightly rightwards via the obvious cracks to the top.</p>
            <p><b>3. Sunai E1 5b * </b>an eliminate line squeezed between the two cracklines trending slightly rightwards past a niche with difficulty to a ledge. Finish via a short black slab trending rightwards. </p>
            <p><b>4. The Nails E1 5b **</b> the next crackline via a collection of railway nails heading slightly rightwards to a tricky finale in the final groove. </p>
            <p><b>5. Soft Times E1 5c * </b>climb the black face 4m right of the Nails, comes a little close at one or two spots, to reach the foot of its groove. Finish up the slab to its left.</p>
            <p><b>6. Welcome to Hard Times E2 5c *** </b>Superb. Fine, technical face climbing up the centre of the wall leads to an impasse at a bulge, thread runner. Pass this with difficult and at the next break step left to finish up the nails. <b>7. The Direct Finish E3 5c * </b>provides further technicalities without the comfort of good protection.</p>
            <p><b>8. Joint Effort HVS 5b ***</b> the classic of the wall with excellent sustained climbing after a difficult initial 5m. Follow the crack</p>
            <p><b>9. Badlands E3 6a </b>these eliminates are growing. Climb the slender pillar between the two cracklines to an impasse at a bulge. Step right and finish via Captain Reliable.</p>
            <p><b>10. Captain Reliable E2 5c ** </b>climbing the next crackline to reach a bulge where the difficulties begin. Pass this to the right and stand up over the bulge via a long reach. Finish more easily.</p>
            <p><b>11. Private Gripped E6 6b * </b>From the top of the crack on Captain Reliable, step left and climb the blank-looking , and it almost is, wall with little or no further gear. Harrowing.</p>
            <p><b>12. Extra Effort E2 5c </b>tackle the blunt pillar to the right of Captain Reliable without resorting to easier ground on the right.</p>
            <p><b>13. Investal HVS 5a </b>a poor vegetated groove and crackline to the right leads into a scoop. Finish on good rock via some obvious calcite holds.</p>
            <p><b>14. Clowning E2 5b * </b>the vague arete of the Investal depression and left of the prominent thin crackline of Cathy's Clown gives steep climbing requiring careful selection of protection.</p>
            <p><b>15. Cathy's Clown E2 5c ** </b>Superb. Climb the centre of the yellow wall via small calcite flutings and thin cracks to reach a bulge wherein the crux lies to reach an open groove above.</p>
            <p><b>16. Cathy's Clown Right-Hand E3 5c ** </b>branches right from the break to climb the wall on small flutings. Incorporates the old direct finish to Liquid Courage.</p>
            <p><b>17. Liquid Courage E2 5b ** </b>another classic pitch taking the fine fluted crack in the yellow-flecked wall. Nowhere hard but just merits the grade because of its steepness. </p>
