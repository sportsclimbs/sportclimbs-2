            <p><b>1. The Stig E2 5c </b>pleasant face climbing via a thin crack from the left-hand side of the alcove.</p>
            <p><b>2. Stig of the Dump E1 5a </b>the thin crack from the right-hand side of the alcove and a short bold wall. Easier above the ledge.</p>
            <p><b>Emblem Embargo HVS 5a </b>left-hand of two thin cracks in sidewall to headwall above obvious niche.</p>
            <p><b>Somebody's Trademark (HVS 5a) </b>the right-hand thin crack to a ledge. Finish by moving right and up via cleaner rock above. </p>
            <p><b>3. Silent Manoeuvres E4 5c &starf; </b>the right-hand side of the left arete of the wall gives superb technical moves with no gear but, unfortunately, the possibility for escape.</p>
            <p><b> 4. Telescopic Demand E3 6a &starf; </b>Excellent technical climbing via the faint thin crackline 5m right of the arete uses a side runner off right and a very long reach. Finish more easily above.</p>
            <p><b>5. Swan Song E1 5b &starf; </b>the vague right-trending rampline and a faint crack above leads to the TD finish.</p>
            <p><b>6. Bicycle Repair Man E1 5b &starf;&starf; </b>the classic of the slab. Tackle the obvious thin crack, difficult, to gain the face proper and a small ledge. Trend slightly leftwards and up to finish via an obvious short wide crack.</p>
            <p><b>7. Top Gear E5 6b &starf; </b>a devious eliminate with some good and very bold climbing: particularly bold at the start and hard from leaving BRM.</p>
            <p><b>8. Charas HVS 5b &starf; </b>the thin central crackline of the slab. The battle with the tree is awkward and the central section of the crack difficult.</p>
            <p><b>9. Mozaic Piece E4 5c &starf; </b>moves right out of Charas above the tree to climb the unprotected face. Even more unprotected is the direct start at E4 5c.</p>
            <p><b>10. Wipe Out E2 5b &starf;&starf; </b>a faint crack above a ledge leads to holds trending leftwards into a tiny groove and bold moves soon easing. The direct start makes it E4 5c.</p>
            <p><b>11. Paraplege E3 5c &starf; </b>From the start of Wipe Out continue straight up the slab via a thin crackline to a hollow finish on the headwall.</p>
            <p><b>12. Amaratarusa VS 4c </b>The slim corner line bounding the right-hand side of the wall with the small overlap providing the difficulties.</p>
            <p><b>13. Titanic Reaction HVS 5a </b>the cracks in the obvious tower give a good route when clean.</p>
            <p><b>14. Insidious Iceberg VS 4c </b>wide crack and corner above.</p>
            <p><b>15. Down She Goes E3 5c </b>the right arete, bold, and easier cracks above.</p>
