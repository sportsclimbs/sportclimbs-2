{.topo .w100}

**Hell Driver HVS 4c**  
The thin crack up left-hand side of slabs to wide crack finish.

**Traffic Cops E2 5b**  
A bold slab to the right going direct to high corner system and cracks above. Bold.

**Fiat HVS 5a**  
The thin crack left of flake direct to angled overlap. Traverse right under this, PR, and finish via *Suscipiat*.

**Herald Vitesse E1 5b *★★***  
Straight up steep wall, PR to gain cleaned ledge. Climb the centre of the face above via a faint crack, cross the overlap and finish via a Sycamore sapling.

**1. Xenophobia E1 5a**  
The left-hand arete of the wall starting via a flake on its left-hand side. Bold and sadly neglected.

**2. Suscipiat VS 4c *★***  
The left edge of the wall leads steeply to fluted cracks and easier climbing slightly rightwards via the obvious cracks to the top.

**3. Sunai E1 5b *★***  
An eliminate line squeezed between the two cracklines trending slightly rightwards past a niche with difficulty to a ledge. Finish via a short black slab trending rightwards.

**4. The Nails E1 5b *★★***  
The next crackline via a collection of railway nails heading slightly rightwards to a tricky finale in the final groove.

**5. Soft Times E1 5c *★***  
Climb the black face 4m right of *The Nails* to reach the foot of its groove. It comes a little close at one or two spots. Finish up the slab to its left.

**6. Welcome to Hard Times E2 5c *★★★***  
Superb. Fine, technical face climbing up the centre of the wall leads to an impasse at a bulge, thread runner. Pass this with difficult and at the next break step left to finish up the nails.

**7. The Direct Finish E3 5c *★***  
Provides further technicalities without the comfort of good protection.

**8. Joint Effort HVS 5b *★★★***  
The classic of the wall with excellent sustained climbing after a difficult initial 5m. Follow the crack.

**9. Badlands E3 6a**  
Climb the slender pillar between the two cracklines to an impasse at a bulge. Step right and finish via *Captain Reliable*.

**10. Captain Reliable E2 5c *★★***  
Climb the next crackline to reach a bulge where the difficulties begin. Pass this to the right and stand up over the bulge via a long reach. Finish more easily.

**11. Private Gripped E6 6b *★***  
From the top of the crack on *Captain Reliable*, step left and climb the blank-looking , and it almost is, wall with little or no further gear. Harrowing.

**12. Extra Effort E2 5c**  
Tackle the blunt pillar to the right of *Captain Reliable* without resorting to easier ground on the right.

**13. Investal HVS 5a**  
A poor vegetated groove and crackline to the right leads into a scoop. Finish on good rock via some obvious calcite holds.

**14. Clowning E2 5b *★***  
The vague arete of the *Investal* depression and left of the prominent thin crackline of *Cathy's Clown* gives steep climbing requiring careful selection of protection.

**15. Cathy's Clown E2 5c *★★***  
Superb. Climb the centre of the yellow wall via small calcite flutings and thin cracks to reach a bulge wherein the crux lies to reach an open groove above.

**16. Cathy's Clown Right-Hand E3 5c *★★***  
Branches right from the break to climb the wall on small flutings. Incorporates the old direct finish to *Liquid Courage*.

**17. Liquid Courage E2 5b *★★***  
Another classic pitch taking the fine fluted crack in the yellow-flecked wall. Nowhere hard but just merits the grade because of its steepness.
