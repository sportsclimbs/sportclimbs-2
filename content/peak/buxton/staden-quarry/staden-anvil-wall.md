![Topo of Anvil Wall, Staden Quarry](/img/peak/buxton/staden-anvil-wall.jpg)
{.topo}

**1. Tout Comprendre E1 5a** 
The left-hand arête beginning part way up the slope. Poor gear.

**2. A Game of Chess E5 6b *★★*** 
A superb technical feast on the blank-looking face via a vague crackline. Immaculate but tricky to work out.

**3. Hammer into Anvil E2 6a** 
Steps left from a block and up via a short-lived sequence of technical moves.

**4. Nice 'n Sleazy E2 5b** 
A vague line on the right-hand side of the slab past a small overlap.

**5. 96 Smears E5 6c *★*** 
The extremely smooth slab to the right. Appropriately named.

**6. Rupert Bear Goes Hiking VS 4c** 
The left-hand crack of two on the slab to the right.

**7. Bimbo the Exploding Lorry Driver's Gulch Eliminate VS 4b** 
The right-hand crack. Care with the exit.

**8. Beau Jest HVS 5a** 
The right-hand arête of the wall.
