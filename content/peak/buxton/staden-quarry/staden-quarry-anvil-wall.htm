            <p> <b>1. Tout Comprendre E1 </b> <b>5a </b>the left-hand arete beginning part way up the slope. Poor gear. </p>
            <p> <b>2. A Game of Chess E5 6b &starf;&starf; </b> a superb technical feast on the blank-looking face via a vague crackline. Immaculate but tricky to work out. </p>
            <p> <b>3. Hammer into Anvil E2 6a </b> Steps left from a block and up via a short-lived sequence of technical moves. </p>
            <p> <b>4. Nice 'n Sleazy E2 5b </b> a vague line on the right-hand side of the slab past a small overlap. </p>
            <p> <b>5. 96 Smears E5 6c &starf; </b> the extremely smooth slab to the right. Appropriately named. </p>
            <p> <b>6. Rupert Bear Goes Hiking VS 4c </b> the left-hand crack of two on the slab to the right. </p>
            <p> <b>7. Bimbo the Exploding Lorry Driver's Gulch Eliminate VS 4b </b> the right-hand crack. Care with the exit. </p>
            <p> <b>8. Beau Jest HVS 5a </b> the right-hand arete of the wall. </p>
