            <h3>Character</h3>

            <p>The narrow ravine close to Morrisons in Buxton gives a handful of pleasant routes with extremely easy access. The rock is excellent quality but unfortunately the routes are only about 10 - 12m in height.</p>
            
            <p>The crag is shady so can be good in hot weather. However it's best avoided in humid conditions.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            
            <p><img src="/img/peak/buxton/Ashwood.gif" width="441" height="257">When approaching from Buxton down the A6, after leaving the roundabout alongside Morrisons, a small layby will be seen on the right-hand side of the road in about 200m. Park here - it is worth noting that it easier to park here when approaching from the opposite direction. </p>

            <p>The ravine is directly behind the parking area. The crags are about 1m walk from the car.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately the first 4 routes appear to have been debolted for unknown reasaons when last checked (2021).</p>
            
            <h3>Layout</h3>
            
            <p>There are three main sections of wall, the first most easily identified on the left-hand side of the ravine when entering it.</p>
            <p>The other routes are on the right-hand side of the ravine, hidden from view but easily identified when walking up the ravine.</p>
