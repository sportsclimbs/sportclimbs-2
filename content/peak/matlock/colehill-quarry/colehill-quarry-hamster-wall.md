**1. The Booze Cruise (6b+) *★***  
A long line climbing the technical wall starting just left of the corner to finish via the fine white tower.

**2. Cruisin' for a Boozin (6b+) *★***  
The right wall of the corner with a tricky balance move low down followed by a long reach. Finish via a hanging flake corner and an easier upper wall.

**3. The Crinoid Cruise E3 5c *★***  
The long fossil-encrusted crackline with the hardest section being in the lower 5m.

**4. Here I am (6c+)** The short intense wall to the right moving into the next route for its finale.

**5. See Me Coming (6c) *★***  
The technical wall right of the crack followed by easier climbing above a small ledge.

**6. The Scarlet Woman (6a+) *★***  
A short and technical gray wall to pleasant face climbing above and at an easier angle.

**7. Crocodile Tears (6c) *★***  
The testing face to the right soon easing above to join the Scarlet Woman.

**8. Alligator Smiles (6a+) *★***  
Slim groove and easier headwall.

**9. Tolley put the Kettle On (6c)** easy start to difficult blind moves from a flake to rounded ledge above. Easier above.

**10. The Convert (7a)** A difficult route with a slappy central section and steep finale. Originally E3 5b!

**11. Forbidden Fruit (6b+) *★***  
The obvious line via a steep start and slabbier walls above. Good.

**12. Farty Towels (6b+)** &starf;

**13. Another Roadside Attraction (6a) *★***  
A long line via a shallow scoop and groove. A good intro to the cliff.

**14. Old King Colehill (6c) *★***  
Excellent face climbing starting via a white streak and with tricky moves above the first BR.

**15. It's a Hamster Mr. Fawlty (6a+) *★***  
The long shallow groove and gray wall above just to the left of the dirty groove bounding the right-hand side of the wall.
