            <p><b>Voyeur (6a) </b>wall left of slim groove.</p>
            <p><b>1. Posing till the End (5) </b>the left-hand arete of the wall.</p>
            <p><b>2. I am a Poser and I Don't Care (5) </b>a direct line to the right keeping to the line of bolts</p>
            <p><b>3. Garth was 'ere (6a) </b>pleasant face climbing, steep to start but gradually easing off.</p>
            <p><b>4. In Vision (6a+) &starf; </b>a faint shallow groove with a technical central section.</p>
            <p><b>5. Out-a-Sight, Out-a-Mind (6a+) </b>long slabby face climbing via shallow groove and scoop. Finish leftwards from last bolt runner </p>

            <p><b>6. Above 30 (7b) &starf; </b>hard start and branches left from second 'ledge' to climb the very thin headwall. Easier for the tall.</p>
