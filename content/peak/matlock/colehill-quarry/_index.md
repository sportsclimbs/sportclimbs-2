## Situation {.mt0}

In the heart of Wirksworth Industrial Estate with ease of access and parking only 80m from the crag.

## Character

A bole of a quarry with good quality gray limestone and some good long wall climbs. Most of the routes are in the 5's and 6's with a couple of 7a's and one 7b.

## Access

The quarry is owned by the Stone Centre and there is now an agreed right of access. Please be respectful of other users.

## Approach

From Cromford, turn off the A6 and head up the steep hill past Black Rocks and under the old railway bridge. Take the first major right when descending the hill, ominously named Ravenstor Road and park at the roundabout/turning area. From the right side of the road follow an obvious track through the trees for about 100 metres to the quarry.


## QuarryÂ Layout

Fairly straightforward. The bole is composed of one compact gray wall divided into three sectors. One to the left of the prominent leaning wall, and one to the right of the long shallow corner in the centre of the crag.
