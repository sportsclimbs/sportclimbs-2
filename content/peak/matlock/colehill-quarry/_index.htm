            <h3>Situation</h3>

            <p>In the heart of Wirskworth Industrial Estate with ease of access and parking only 80m from the crag.</p>

            <h3>Character</h3>

            <p>A bole of a quarry with good quality gray limestone and some good long wall climbs. All of the routes are in the 6s save one and should prove very amenable.</p>

            <h3 style="clear: both;">Approach</h3>

                From Cromford, turn off the A6 and head up the steep hill past Black Rocks and under the old railway bridge. Take the first major right when descending the hill, ominously named Ravenstor Road and at the roundabout/turning area, turn right up the obvious track on the right. The quarry lies straight ahead.
            </p>

            <h3>Quarry&nbsp;Layout</h3>

            <p>Fairly straightforward. The bole is composed of one compact gray wall divided into three sectors. One to the left of the prominent leaning wall, and one to the right of the long shallow corner in the centre of the crag.</p>

            <h3>Access</h3>

            <p>The quarry is owned by the Stone Centre and <span class="warning">there is currently no agreed right of access. This is currently under review with the <abbr title="British Mountaineering Council">BMC</abbr> involved.</span></p>
