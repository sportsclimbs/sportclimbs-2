            <p><b>1. The Booze Cruise (6b+) * </b>a long line climbing the technical wall starting just left of the corner to finish via the fine white tower.</p>
            <p><b>2. Cruisin' for a Boozin (6b+) *</b> the right wall of the corner with a tricky balance move low down followed by a long reach. Finish via a hanging flake corner and an easier upper wall.</p>
            <p><b>3. The Crinoid Cruise E3 5c *</b> the long fossil-encrusted crackline with the hardest section being in the lower 5m. </p>
            <p><b>4. Here I am (6c+) </b>The short intense wall to the right moving into the next route for its finale.</p>
            <p><b>5. See Me Coming (6c) * </b>the technical wall right of the crack followed by easier climbing above a small ledge.</p>
            <p><b>6. The Scarlet Woman (6a+) *</b> a short and technical gray wall to pleasant face climbing above and at an easier angle. </p>
            <p><b>7. Crocodile Tears (6c) * </b>the testing face to the right soon easing above to join the Scarlet Woman.</p>
            <p><b>8. Alligator Smiles (6a+) * </b>slim groove and easier headwall.</p>
            <p><b>9. Tolley put the Kettle On (6c) </b>easy start to difficult blind moves from a flake to rounded ledge above. Easier above. </p>
            <p><b>10. The Convert (7a) </b>A difficult route with a slappy central section and steep finale. Originally E3 5b! </p>
            <p><b>11. Forbidden Fruit (6b+) * </b>the obvious line via a steep start and slabbier walls above. Good.</p>
            <p><b>12. Another Roadside Attraction (6a) * </b>a long line via a shallow scoop and groove. A good intro to the cliff.</p>
            <p><b>13. Old King Colehill (6c) *</b> excellent face climbing starting via a white streak and with tricky moves above the first BR.</p>
            <p><b>14. It's a Hamster Mr. Fawlty (6a+) * </b>the long shallow groove and gray wall above just to the left of the dirty groove bounding the right-hand side of the wall.</p>
