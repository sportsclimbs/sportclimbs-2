**1. At the edge of Everything E2 5c**  
A short tricky bulge, PR, leads via a break, TR, to a ledge. Easier climbing leads to a tree.

**2. Lower Buttress Route E3 5c *★***  
Tackle the lower bulges direct before following a right-leaning groove to a break. Move left across this and up to the top.

**3. Beautiful White E3 5c *★***  
A direct assault of the lower bulges, PR, onto the fine crisp headwall, TR. A super little pitch.

**Chiggers E3 5c *★***  
Starts up *Still Searching* and climbs the grey pillar to the left of *Beautiful White*.

**Still Searching E1 5b**  
Climbs leftwards up the buttress into the edge of the ivy, finishing by a prominent grooveline.

**4. If Dill was here (6b)**  
Pleasant climbing up the slim wall left of the vegetated left-facing chimney.

**5. Memo to Sally E3 5c *★***  
Climb the shallow scoop/corner to the left to gain a break. Move left and follow the shallow groove to the top. BB

**6. Lulu Belle E4 6a *★***  
Climb direct up the blunt rib to boldly gain the upper section of *Memo to Sally*.

**7. Prejudice E3 5c *★***  
The excellent groove and crackline to the left move right just above a PR to pass the upper overhangs. BB.

**8. Scoobs (6c) *★***  
The superb delicate face to the left finishing via the steepening crackline.

**9. My Pedigree Chum (6a+) *★***  
The face and blunt rib to the left and just right of the prominent gash.

**10. Scimitar groove VS 4c**  
The huge gash is excellent but is currently in need of a clean.

**11. Endgame (7a) *★***  
The right-hand of two excellent face route up the leaning pillar with a fingery finale.

**12. Saga Lout (6c) *★***  
A superb direct assault of the white pillar gives excellent climbing.

**13. Sargasso Sea E4 5c**  
The blackened scoop trending rightwards to exit on some unsound rock. You can also the lower off on the last route. Serious

**14. Black Wedding E5 6a**  
A direct line up the wall to the left via 3BRS and 2PRS. Bold

**15. Venus Eruptus (7a)**  
From just left of the yew tree, climb the very technical wall and pumpy upper section of the wall.

**16. Dutch Moon (6b+) *★★***  
A little gem. The face to the left and just right of the huge pillar gives fine technical climbing throughout.

**17. Memories (6a) *★***  
Another very fine pitch taking a direct line up the face around to the left of the huge pilla*r.

**18. Zed Legs E2 5b★**  
A fine route connecting the two ramps on the wall to the left, exiting rightwards from the top of the second.

**19. Y Front E2 5b *★***  
A very fine pitch. From the obvious cleaned break in the path, climb starlight up the wall, TR, then slightly right to a second TR. Stand up and move leftwards along the break to exit at a thin crack, BB.

**20. That X Factor E4 6a *★***  
Superb climbing. From the first TR on Y Front, move left and climb the buttress front direct past a TR to the bulge, PR. Pull up and right to a second PR and climb the face finishing via a crack on the left. BB.

**21. All the Wubble u's E3 5c**  
Climb the shallow groove on the left-hand side of the buttress and enter a shallow groove, PR. Finish via the thin crack on the right to a BB.

**Sideways (6c)**  
The right-hand side of the bay at a higher level to the left.

**Lee Way E5 6b**  
The right-hand of two lines on the face up and to the left.
