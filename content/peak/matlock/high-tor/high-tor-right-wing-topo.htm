            <p><b>1. At the edge of Everything E2 5c </b>a short tricky bulge, PR, leads via a break, TR, to a ledge. Easier climbing leads to a tree.</p>
            <p><b>2. Lower Buttress Route E3 5c &starf;</b> tackles the lower bulges direct before following a right-leaning groove to a break. Move left across this and up to the top.</p>
            <p><b>3. Beautiful White E3 5c &starf; </b>a direct assault of the lower bulges, PR, onto the fine crisp headwall, TR. A super little pitch.</p>
            <p><b>Chiggers E3 5c &starf; </b>starts up Still Searching and climbs the grey pillar to the left of Beautiful White</p>
            <p><b>Still Searching E1 5b</b> climbs leftwards up the buttress into the edge of the ivy, finishing by a prominent grooveline.</p>
            <p><b>4. If Dill was here (6b)</b> pleasant climbing up the slim wall left of the vegetated left-facing chimney.</p>
            <p><b>5. Memo to Sally E3 5c &starf; </b>the shallow scoop/corner to the left to gain a break. Move left and follow the shallow groove to the top. BB</p>
            <p><b>6. Lulu Belle E4 6a &starf; </b>climbs direct up the blunt rib to boldly gain the upper section of Memo to Sally.</p>
            <p><b>7. Prejudice E3 5c &starf; </b>the excellent groove and crackline to the left move right just above a PR to pass the upper overhangs. BB.</p>
            <p><b>8. Scoobs (6c) &starf; </b>the superb delicate face to the left finishing via the steepening crackline.</p>
            <p><b>9. My Pedigree Chum (6a+) &starf; </b>the face and blunt rib to the left and just right of the prominent gash.</p>
            <p><b>10. Scimitar groove VS 4c </b> the huge gash is excellent but is currently in need of a clean.</p>
            <p><b>11. Endgame (7a) &starf; </b>the right-hand of two excellent face route up the leaning pillar with a fingery finale.</p>
            <p><b>12. Saga Lout (6c) &starf; </b>a superb direct assault of the white pillar gives excellent climbing.</p>
            <p><b>13. Sargasso Sea E4 5c </b>the blackened scoop trending rightwards to exit on some unsound rock. You can also the lower off on the last route. Serious</p>
            <p><b>14. Black Wedding E5 6a </b>a direct line up the wall to the left via 3BRS and 2PRS. Bold</p>
            <p><b>15. Venus Eruptus (7a) </b> from just left of the yew tree, climb the very technical wall and pumpy upper section of the wall.</p>
            <p><b>16. Dutch Moon (6b+) &starf;&starf; </b>a little gem. The face to the left and just right of the huge pillar gives fine technical climbing throughout.</p>
            <p><b>17. Memories (6a) &starf;</b>another very fine pitch taking a direct line up the face around to the left of the huge pillar. </p>
            <p><b>18. Zed Legs E2 5b&starf; </b>a fine route connecting the two ramps on the wall to the left, exiting rightwards from the top of the second.</p>
            <p><b>19. Y Front E2 5b &starf; </b>a very fine pitch. From the obvious cleaned break in the path, climb starlight up the wall, TR, then slightly right to a second TR. Stand up and move leftwards along the break to exit at a thin crack, BB.</p>
            <p><b>20. That X Factor E4 6a &starf; </b>superb climbing. From the first TR on Y Front, move left and climb the buttress front direct past a TR to the bulge, PR. Pull up and right to a second PR and climb the face finishing via a crack on the left. BB.</p>
            <p><b>21. All the Wubble u's E3 5c </b>Climb the shallow groove on the left-hand side of the buttress and enter a shallow groove, PR. Finish via the thin crack on the right to a BB.</p>
            <p><b>Sideways (6c) </b>the right-hand side of the bay at a higher level to the left.</p>
            <p><b>Lee Way E5 6b </b>the right-hand of two lines on the face up and to the left.</p>
            <p><b>My Way (7a+) </b>&starf; the left-hand line. </p>
            <p><b>No Way (6b+) </b>shorter wall on left on immaculate rock.</p>
