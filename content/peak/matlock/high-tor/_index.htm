            <h3>Character</h3>

            <p>A fine redevelopment of an existing crag with a complete clean up of the original routes and a number of excellent new additions, some traditional and some sport.</p>
            <p>Make sure you take a trad. rack as well as a sport rack as all of the routes are on excellent rock and well worth doing. A great evening venue with quick access and quick-drying rock.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p><img src="/img/peak/matlock/HTMAP1.gif" WIDTH="253" HEIGHT="366">This is quite straightforward. Park in one of the laybys giving on the road below the crag on the A6 in Matlock bath and cross the bridge over the river. Go through the tunnel and once past the cable car station break left into High Tor grounds. Go up to the top of the steps, and climb over the fence to follow the path to below the crag in about 5 minutes.</p>

            <h3>Access</h3>

            <p>Access is permitted on the agreement that there are no more new routes added and that no further gardening of the crag or its area is carried out.</p>
