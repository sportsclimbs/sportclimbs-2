## Situation
![Blue Lagoon map 1](/img/peak/matlock/BLUEMAP1.gif)

This enormous abandoned quarry is situated on the edge of Wirksworth, a major feature being two blue pools of unknown depth. There is an amazing amount of exposed rock in the quarry, most of which is in a very poor state. However, this isolated wall is very solid and the routes, although compact, are of top quality.

## Character

The wall is mostly vertical and approximately 10m high. Although short, the routes are quite intense with plenty of technical moves and they feel a lot longer. Good technique, stamina and finger strength will come in handy.



## Approach

The sensible approach is from the small lay-by on the left just after the Limekiln pub in Wirksworth when travelling towards Middleton - please don't climb over the main gates higher up the road. From the lay-by go straight up between the big stones then straight on for 100m to a small path going up to the right. Go over a trashed fence and then onto a larger fence which you can duck under. Carry on into the quarry passing the main gate on the right. Follow the track leftwards and you will see the obvious smooth-looking wall on the right, tucked away and out of sight of the road.

## Quarry Layout

Facing south the wall gets any sun going, except in an evening, and gets very little seepage except after very long spells of wet weather.

## Access

Although used regularly by dog walkers, please remember that you are not supposed to be in the quarry. To ensure longevity of the climbing always keep a low profile.
