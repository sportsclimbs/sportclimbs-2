The first two routes are situated at the top of the scree slop to the left on a fine grey slab.

**1. Funnelly Enough (6c) *★***  
The central line of the slab gives a fine climb with intricate climbing from the word go.

**2. No Fun at All (6b)**  
The right-hand side of the slab with a scary third clip.

**3. Burnt Offerings (6c+)**  
The left-hand line of the wall just to the right of the arete requires three long pulls.

**4. The Cinderbox (6c)**  
The steep wall left of the shallow groove with a long move at the top.

**5. In Sin I Rate Her (6a+)**  
The pleasant shallow groove gives the warm up for the walls.

**6. Burnt to a Cinder (7a)**  
The wall and faint groove to the right with long pulls at the top.

**7. Charred (6c+) *★***  
The excellent wall to the right with a few intense moves.

**8. Burn Baby Burn (7a) *★***  
The centre of the wall is sustained and fingery.

**9. The Hot Spot (6c)**  
The right-hand arete with the crux situated in the final moves.
