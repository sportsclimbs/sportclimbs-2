            <p>The large back wall of the quarry, very similar to St Govan's Head in appearance gives a host of very good traditional pitches with the occasional sport and mixed pitches. </p>

            <p>The wall can be divided into three main sectors the most central of which provides some very good pitches. These sections are subdivided as follows: </p>

            <p><a href="caretaker-quarry-the-amistad-walls.htm">Amistad Walls</a>: these stretch from the right-hand side of the wall which has a scree slope below it to a long slim grooveline almost in the centre of the walls. Here can be found a handful of excellent and long pitches in the mid extreme grade. </p>

            <p><a href="caretaker-quarry-numero-uno-wall.htm">Numero Walls</a>: dominated by the central crackline of the wall, these offer half a dozen superb wall pitches on fine rock with an amount of fixed gear. The Giant Pot, Big Thing Coming and For Intake's Sake should not be missed. </p>

            <p><a href="caretaker-quarry-abide-walls.htm">Abide Walls</a>: the left-hand side of the walls are identified by a prominent mud-filled chimney with an impressive left-hand arete, itself providing another classic pitch. </p>
