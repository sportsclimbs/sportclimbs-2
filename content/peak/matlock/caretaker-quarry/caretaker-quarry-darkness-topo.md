summary: New topo for this popular wall in Caretaker Quarry
placeholder: false
---

The Darkness Walls face north east and thus get almost no sun so a great place for hot day. The rock is some of the best in the quarry.

When walking around from the Take Away Wall a series of walls provides three routes on unusually bubbly rock: **Unhappy Hour (6c)** a short steep pillar at a higher level with excellent fingery moves, **Nappy Hour (5)** a bubbly face past a prominent thread and **White Tripe (5)** a prominent cleaned strip.

Before reaching the main area of the Darkness Walls is a prominent pillar with three sport routes upon it. These are: 

**Unlimited Choice (5)** a slim pillar just left of the routes marked. Pleasant.

**My Furious Tortoise (6b)** &starf; the centre of the tower gives fine open climbing

**Life Has No Porpoise (6a)**  the right edge of the tower again with excellent moves.

**The Shambling (6b)** an isolated pillar to the right which at the moment is dusty and has a few hollow holds.

All of the routes on the main Darkness Walls have double bolt belays at their base.

**1. Dashboard (5)** pleasant face route to large flake. A little dusty at present

**2. Join the Dots (5)** easy pleasant wall, left-hand of three at high level. Worth doing.

**3. See Spot Run(6b+)** &starf; pleasant central pillar with excellent moves.

**4. In a Dash (6c)** right-hand pillar, slightly dirty at the start. Worthwhile above.

**5. Dashdance (6a)** left-hand side of pillar at higher level.

**6. Spot's the Difference (6a)** right-hand side of prominent pillar with overlap and good climbing. 

**7. The Clumps (5)** &starf; left-hand side of main wall gives classic pitch of easy standard. Better after traffic.

**8. A Sharp Intake of Breath (6b)** &starf; central line via faint crackline on wall. A future classic. Sustained.

**9. Brain Candy (6b)** &starf; pleasant face climbing on right edge of wall to joint belay. _New belay added_

**10. Stinking Rose (6b+)** &starf; tricky start through bulge and flake to more fine open face. _New belay added_

**11. Prickly Pose (6c+)** &starf; fine face climbing with a sting in the tail on the slim wall to the right of Stinking Rose. _New belay added_

**12. Rabbit Proof Fence (6c)** &starf;&starf; superb isolated pillar, just worth grade. Will become even better after traffic. _New belay added_

**13. Brer Faced Cheek (6c)** &starf; rightwards line off from Rabbit Proof with good moves and one short difficult section. _New belay added_

**14. No Country for Old Men (6b)** A good pitch up left-hand side of face after arete start. _New belay added_

**15. Intolerable Cruelty (7a)** &starf; left side of arete to ledge then superb, intricate upper wall with well-defined crux. _New belay added_

**16. Intake it or Leave it (6b)** &starf; a surprisingly good pitch taking the prominent crack in the centre of the wall. Fine climbing. _New belay added_

**17. Tucker's Grave (6c+)** &starf;&starf; yet another long fine pitch up the main black wall. Difficulties centred around 8m section. _New belay added_

**18. Plum Tuckered Out (6b)** &starf;&starf;&starf; the right-hand side of the main black wall via a crack. Gives a peek at the last route. _New belay added_

**19. Two Tuck In (6b+)** &starf; long pitch via left-hand side of wall to right. Sustained effort, gradually easing.

**20. Friar Tuck (6c)** well cleaned lower wall past orange patch to thin crack system. Needs more cleaning.

**21. Tuck-Shop Brawl (6b+)** &starf; branches right off Friar Tuck to take pleasant pillar.

**22. Can't Teach 'em Nowt (6c)** &starf; moves leftwards from That'll Teach up to a ledge. Then goes left and up via the fine arete.

**23. That'll Teach 'em (7a)** &starf; highly technical face climb with loads of tricky moves.

**24. A Jam's as good as a Rest E3 5c** &starf;&starf; the stepped crackline to the right. The belay of the last route can be utilised for a descent.

**25. Red Zingers E3 5c** &starf;&starf; the prominent twisting crack in the side wall moving left from porthole to finish via a thin crack.

**26. Dead Ringer (6c+)** &starf;&starf; brilliant open wall climbing just over vertical. Sustained and a future classic.

**27. Looky Likey (6b+)** &starf; a fine open wall climb starting via the right arete of the Dead Ringer wall and climbing slightly rightwards onto the face after a steep start. Fine rock.

The following routes lie to the right and can be gained from the lower pitch of *Orchid* or swinging across after doing *Looky Likey*.

**28. Flowering Beauty (6b)** another good route from the Our Kid's Orchid halfway ledge taking a wall and blunt arete to a fine finish.

**29. My Petal (6c)** climbs the prominent layback corner and exits with difficulty to a ledge. Trend rightwards to the belay.

**30. Mon Dichor (7a)** &starf; the thin crack in the severely leaning wall to the right with a short fingery section. Uphill! 

**31. Our Kid's Orchid (6c,7a)** &starf;&starf; A fine two pitch route aiming for the left-hand arete of the chimney. Superb. The lower pitch can now be done in its own right at 6c.

**32. Crack of Dawn E2 5a, 5b** &starf; takes the scruffy lower crack right of Our Kid's Orchid followed by the impressive straight crack to its right. A superb upper half.

**33. DI Fontaine (7a)** &starf;&starf; a superb route tucked into the gully wall right of Crack of Dawn and gained by a traverse right from the first pitch of Our Kid's Orchid to a BB with karabiner. -->
