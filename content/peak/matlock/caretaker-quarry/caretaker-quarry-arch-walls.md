This once large and impressive buttress has recently received a massive rockfall and its routes have consequently been seriously affected. Those on the right remain pleasant should you dare to cross the impressive boulder field below.

**Bone Ible (6c)**  
A big atmospheric pitch up the huge white pillar at the left-hand side of the wall. Plenty of atmosphere and plenty of clips - 13.

**1. I Love Bakewell Tarts! (6a+)**  
A pleasant route taking the left-hand side of the sharp arête tucked into the back of the chimney to the right. Short tricky section over bulge

**2. Stoney Broke (7a)**  
Impressive hanging pillar above Tarts with some intricate moves above the roof. Atmospheric.

**3. Problems Afoot (5)**  
A pleasant slabby face after a steep and juggy start. Worthwhile.

**4. The Man Comes Around (6c+)**  
A long atmospheric route via an impressive gray wall aiming for a faint groove high up. Plenty of climbing but nowhere desperate.

**5. The Cuckoo Waltz (6a+)**  
The slim wall starting via an arête just right of a slim cave. Worthwhile.

**6. Silencio (6a+)**  
The centre of the prominent slab and the headwall above to the right gives a fine pitch.

**7. Dead Calm (6b)**  
The arête to the right again with the occasional hollow hold.
