            <p>This once large an impressive buttress has recently received a massive rockfall and its routes have consequently been seriously affected. Those on the right remain pleasant should you dare to cross the impressive boulder filed below.</p>
            <p><b>Bone Ible (6c)</b> a big atmospheric pitch up the huge white pillar at the left-hand side of the wall. Plenty of atmosphere and plenty of clips - 13.</p>
            <p><b>1. I Love Bakewell Tarts! (6a+) </b>a pleasant route taking the left-hand side of the sharp arete tucked into the back of the chimney to the right. Short tricky section over bulge</p>
            <p><b>2. Stoney Broke (7a) </b>impressive hanging pillar above Tarts with some intricate moves above the roof. Atmospheric.</p>
            <p><b>3. Problems Afoot (5) </b>a pleasant slabby face after a steep and juggy start. Worthwhile.</p>
            <p><b>4. The Man Comes Around (6c+) </b>A long atmospheric route via an impressive gray wall aiming for a faint groove high up. Plenty of climbing but nowhere desperate.</p>
            <p><b>5. The Cuckoo Waltz (6a+) </b>the slim wall starting via an arete just right of a slim cave. Worthwhile.</p>
            <p><b>6. Silencio (6a+) * </b>The centre of the prominent slab and the headwall above to the right gives a fine pitch. </p>
            <p><b>7. Dead Calm (6b) </b>The arete to the right again with the occasional hollow hold.</p>
