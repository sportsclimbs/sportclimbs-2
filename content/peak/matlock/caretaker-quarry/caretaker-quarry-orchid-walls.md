These walls form the right-hand side of the Darkness Walls and form almost two tiers.

**1. Can't Teach 'em Nowt (6c) *★***  
Moves leftwards from That'll Teach up to a ledge. Then goes left and up via the fine arête.

**2. That'll Teach 'em (7a) *★***  
Highly technical face climb with loads of tricky moves.

**3. Red Zingers E3 5c *★★***  
The prominent twisting crack in the side wall moving left from porthole to finish via a thin crack.

**4. Dead Ringer (6c+) *★★***  
Brilliant open wall climbing just over vertical. Sustained and a future classic.

**5. Looky Likey (6b+) *★***  
A fine open wall climb starting via the right arête of the Dead Ringer wall and climbing slightly rightwards onto the face after a steep start. Fine rock.

The following routes lie to the right and can be gained from the lower pitch of 'Orchid'or swinging across after doing *Looky Likey*.

**6. Flowering Beauty (6b)**  
Another good route from the Our Kid's Orchid halfway ledge taking a wall and blunt arête to a fine finish.

**7. My Petal (6c)**  
Climbs the prominent layback corner and exits with difficulty to a ledge. Trend rightwards to the belay.

**8. Mon Dichor (7a) *★***  
The thin crack in the severely leaning wall to the right with a short fingery section. Uphill!

**9. Our Kid's Orchid (6c,7a) *★★***  
A fine two pitch route aiming for the left-hand arête of the chimney. Superb. The lower pitch can now be done in its own right at 6c.

**10. Crack of Dawn E2 5a, 5b *★***  
Takes the scruffy lower crack right of Our Kid's Orchid followed by the impressive straight crack to its right. A superb upper half.

**11. DI Fontaine (7a) *★★***  
A superb route tucked into the gully wall right of Crack of Dawn and gained by a traverse right from the first pitch of Our Kid's Orchid to a BB with karabiner.
