            <p>These walls form the right-hand side of the Darkness Walls and form almost two tiers. </p>
            <p> <b>1. Can't Teach 'em Nowt (6c) *</b> moves leftwards from That'll Teach up to a ledge. Then goes left and up via the fine arete. </p>
            <p> <b>2. That'll Teach 'em (7a) *</b> highly technical face climb with loads of tricky moves. </p>
            <p> <b>3. Red Zingers E3 5c ** </b> the prominent twisting crack in the side wall moving left from porthole to finish via a thin crack. </p>
            <p> <b>4. Dead Ringer (6c+) **</b> brilliant open wall climbing just over vertical. Sustained and a future classic. </p>
            <p> <b>5. Looky Likey (6b+) * </b> a fine open wall climb starting via the right arete of the Dead Ringer wall and climbing slightly rightwards onto the face after a steep start. Fine rock. </p>
            <p> <I>The following routes lie to the right and can be gained from the lower pitch of 'Orchid'or swinging across after doing Looky Likey</I> </p>
            <p> <b>6. Flowering Beauty (6b) </b> another good route from the Our Kid's Orchid halfway ledge taking a wall and blunt arete to a fine finish. </p>
            <p> <b>7. My Petal (6c) </b> climbs the prominent layback corner and exits with difficulty to a ledge. Trend rightwards to the belay. </p>
            <p> <b>8. Mon Dichor (7a) * </b> the thin crack in the severely leaning wall to the right with a short fingery section. Uphill! </p>
            <p> <b>9. Our Kid's Orchid (6c,7a) ** </b> A fine two pitch route aiming for the left-hand arete of the chimney. Superb. The lower pitch can now be done in its own right at 6c. </p>
            <p> <b>10. Crack of Dawn E2 5a, 5b * </b> takes the scruffy lower crack right of Our Kid's Orchid followed by the impressive straight crack to its right. A superb upper half. </p>
            <p> <b>11. DI Fontaine (7a) ** </b> a superb route tucked into the gully wall right of Crack of Dawn and gained by a traverse right from the first pitch of Our Kid's Orchid to a BB with karabiner.</p>
