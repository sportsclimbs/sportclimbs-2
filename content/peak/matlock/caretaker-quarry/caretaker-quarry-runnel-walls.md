{.topo .w100}

This is the series of walls right of the arch walls and recognizable by their orange nature and crackline towards their right-hand side. At their left-hand side is a prominent runnel/tube towards the top of the cliff which gives a unique pitch via a prominent runnel high up.

The first three routes begin at a higher level on the level, in situ rope providing access.

**1. Impartial Sauce (6b)**  
Steep entry into a bottomless groove exiting right below the roof.
{.mt0}

**2. Partial to Sauce (6c)**  
A direct assault of the prominent rib gives fine climbing with short difficulties

**3. Ketchup (6b)**  
The bulge and thin crackline to the right. Move left and up to the belay.

**4. Up a Gum Tree (6b)**  
The left-hand and shortest route via a groove, overlap, short wall and slab.

**5. Going Full Boar (6c+) *★***  
A taxing little pitch starting to the left of the main runnel. Climb via a groove and overlap and steep wall to a black slab.

**6. Finding Neverland (6a+) *★***  
Take the obvious easy start and after the sixth bolt step left, up via a slab to a roof, over and up the prominent fluted line

**7. El Sergio (6a) *★★***  
The superb runnel gained via some easy ledges, a slabby wall and overlap and gives a fine climb destined for classic status. A tad dusty.

**8. Add the Advil (6b) *★★***  
Another long line right again via an open slab, short steep wall and avoiding the overlap on the right. Again excellent.

**9. Twelve O'clock Nick (5+)**  
The easier right-hand line of four via cleaned ledges and s alb to a steep cracked white wall.
