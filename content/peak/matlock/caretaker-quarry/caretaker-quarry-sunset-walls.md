These are the walls running rightwards from the Amistad Walls giving a series of broken sections of cliff intermingled with arêtes and corners. Generally poor rock is to be found here.

**1. Sunbusting (6b)**  
Short tricky pillar leading to a hollow wall and steep solid finale.

Straightforward climbing throughout keeping left of the pinnace. Crux at the start.
