            <p>These are the walls running rightwards from the Amistad Walls giving a series of broken sections of cliff intermingled with aretes and corners. Generally poor rock is to be found here.</p>
            <p><b>1. Sunbusting (6b) </b>short tricky pillar leading to a hollow wall and steep solid finale.</p>
            <p><b>2. Sunover (6a) </b>straightforward climbing throughout keeping left of the pinnace. Crux at the start.</p>
            <p><b>3. Sunset Stripped (6b) </b>the first route on the large expanse of wall with tricky moves lower down, easing higher up. </p>
            <p><b>4. Sunny Un-D (6b) </b>blunt rib and fine headwall. Will be better with a bit of traffic.</p>
            <p><b>5. Collapsing Sunset (6a) </b>a poor route at the top of the slope, just left of a chimney</p>
            <p><b>6. Sundrain (4) </b>left-hand side of wall.</p>
            <p><b>7. Sunquenched (5) </b>wall just left of arete.</p>
            <p><b>8. Sunrise, Sunset (5) * </b>fine climbing on an excellent isolated arete.</p>

            <p><b>9. Rok it to the Moon (6a) </b>the left-hand wall of two routes situated further right. Good climbing</p>
            <p><b>10. Moon Landings (6a) </b>the right-hand wall, slightly more contrived low down.</p>
            <p><b>11. Lunar Eclipse (6a) </b>black face with stretchy start to fine face above ledge with good climbing.</p>
