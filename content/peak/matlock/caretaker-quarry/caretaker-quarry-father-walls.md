            <h2>Father Walls</h2>
            <p>In the back of the bay 80m to the left of the Take Away wall is a fine tower of excellent unusual rock with five worthwhile pitches.</p>

            <p><b>1. The Fatherhood (6a) </b>fine gray wall with tricky finale</p>
            <p><b>2. Fatherly Advice (5) </b>the pillar left of the wide chimney/crack</p>
            <p><b>3. In My Father's House (6a) </b>left-hand of two longer lines</p>
            <p><b>Unnamed (6a) </b> very worthwhile pitch using belay on left for descent.</p>
            <p><b>4. Farther, Dear Farther (6a) * </b>the right-hand line which is well worth seeking out</p>
            <p><b>5. Love yer Dad (6a) </b>the wall and short arete above a prominent cleaned ledge.</p>

            <h2>Shots Wall</h2>

            <p>Opposite to the Take Away Wall is a face riddled with shot-holes. Nine routes have been done here. From left to right these are:</p>
            <p><b>1. Tosh (5) </b>left most line pas scar</p>
            <p><b>2. Bullshot (5) </b>easy start, one move slab</p>
            <p><b>3. Triple Barrel (5) </b>blunt rib and face</p>
            <p><b>4. Geoff Capes (5) </b>slight pillar to face above grassy ledge</p>
            <p><b>5. A Shot in the Arm (5) </b>slabby wall with blunt rib high up</p>
            <p><b>6. A Shot to the Head (6a) </b>easier lower groove and pleasant upper face.</p>
            <p><b>7. Shotgun (6b) </b>fine face and easier wall above ledge. Best of bunch</p>
            <p><b>8. Shoot Out (5) </b>dirty rib and upper wall. Very poor at moment.</p>
            <p><b>All Shot Down (6b) </b>left-hand of two lines on wall 80m to right.</p>
            <p><b>Calling the Shots (5) </b>fine vague pillar right.</p>
