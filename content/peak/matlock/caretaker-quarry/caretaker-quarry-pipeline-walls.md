This is the first section of cliff seen on right-hand side of the quarry. Its orange colour and numerous crack and corner lines are clear identifying features. Two routes here require the dreaded ENP placement, in other words an RP5 stuffed into a hole. The routes are described from right to left beginning with the first wall reached when entering the right-hand side of the quarry.

The crack and upper arête to the ledge, the crux being to commit to the arête.

A short arête followed by the pleasant face above. 2ENPs! (RP5 placements)

**9. Pipeline arête (5) *★***  
Steep start (wires?) to pleasing arête and easier face above. Belay out left.

The wall to the left gives a good pitch.

The wall at the top of the slope, just left of a prominent arête

The next section of rock slightly beyond the first wall gives a slabby area of gray rock with few prominent features.
