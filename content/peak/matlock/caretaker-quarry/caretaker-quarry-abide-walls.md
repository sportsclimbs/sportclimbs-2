The left-hand side of the back wall is dominated by a huge mud-filled chimney, the walls to its left deteriorating in height.

**1. QE3 (6b)**  
Tucked in the alcove up and to the left a prominent arête with tricky moves past the last BR.
{.mt0}

**2. Freddy's Last Finale E1 5b**  
The left-hand of two line via a steep start on a flake to gain a ledge. The 'runnel'above leads to a short steep headwall.

**3. Mercury Times E2 5c *★***  
The right-hand line of a pair via a couple of TRs and some steep and excellent moves lead onto the arête and some impressive crinoids!

**4. Don't Pontificate (6c) *★***  
A short technical face climb making the most of the rock in the centre of the wall to the left. Short hard section.

**5. Abrade with Me (6b) *★★***  
A superb long route with a tricky move just below mid-height and a fine finish via a zig-zag jamming crack.

**6. Abide With Me E3 5c *★★★***  
Takes the left arête of the chimney. A classic. Climb the easy initial ramp to gain the arête and follow this, mainly on its right-hand side to a ledge, PR. The final arête, taken head on, contains a TR and 2PRs and has superb positions.

**7. Friends, Romans, Countrymen E2 5c *★***  
Takes the right arête of the prominent chimney. From the obvious ramp, swing out right and through a bulge and up the wall, 3BRs, to a ledge. Step left and climb the scalloped wall on magnificent rock to gain the fine flying arête to finish. Well protected throughout.

**8. Pope on a Rope (6a+)**  
Short warm-up style pitch via pleasant enough wall.

**9. Papal Rain E3 5c *★★***  
The impressive shallow groove and soaring crack above leads to a fine jamming crack slightly left. Atmospheric.

**10. Pope Idol (6c) *★***  
Short and steep section with good moves after a hollow start.

**11. Hollowed Ground (6b+)**  
A short route in the centre of the wall with a couple of hollow holds.

**12. Benedictine (6b+)**  
A big long route taking the full height of the wall. A little dusty low down but with a fine upper half above the ledge. Needs traffic.

**13. A Brown Understudy (6a)**  
The slim pillar left of a chimney to a half-height belay. Lies just to the left of the Numero Uno Walls**: A White Oversight (6b+) *★***  
The upper wall gives a fine finale on excellent rock

**14. Totally Out-a-White (6c)**  
The right edge of the pillar with technical moves.
