            <p>This is the series of walls right of the arch walls and recognizable by their orange nature and crackline towards their right-hand side. At their left-hand side is a prominent runnel/tube towards the top of the cliff which gives a unique pitch via a prominent runnel high up.

            <p>The first three routes begin at a higher level on the level, in situ rope providing access.</p>

            <p><b>1. Impartial Sauce (6b) </b>steep entry into a bottomless groove exiting right below the roof.</p>
            <p><b>2. Partial to Sauce (6c) </b>a direct assault of the prominent rib gives fine climbing with short difficulties</p>
            <p><b>3. Ketchup (6b) </b>the bulge and thin crackline to the right. Move left and up to the belay.</p>
            <p><b>4. Up a Gum Tree (6b) </b>the left-hand and shortest route via a groove, overlap, short wall and slab. </p>
            <p><b>5. Going Full Boar (6c+) *</b> a taxing little pitch starting to the left of the main runnel. Climb via a groove and overlap and steep wall to a black slab.</p>
            <p><b>6. Finding Neverland (6a+) *</b> take the obvious easy start and after the sixth bolt step left, up via a slab to a roof, over and up the prominent fluted line</p>
            <p><b>7. El Sergio (6a) ** </b>the superb runnel gained via some easy ledges, a slabby wall and overlap and gives a fine climb destined for classic status. A tad dusty. </p>
            <p><b>8. Add the Advil (6b) ** </b>Another long line right again via an open slab, short steep wall and avoiding the overlap on the right. Again excellent.</p>
            <p><b>9. Twelve O'clock Nick (5+) </b>the easier right-hand line of four via cleaned ledges and s alb to a steep cracked white wall.</p>
