## Character

This is a huge quarry with a very expansive array of impressive walls. Some of these have produced a network of quality traditional climbs, not unlike Pembroke whilst other walls have provided some superb sport climbs.

Many of these sport climbs are of significant height (20m+) and are of a quality of rock more akin to Portland than anywhere else in the country.

## Access

It should be made clear that Tarmac does not consent to any climbing activity on its property and that this site in no way aims to encourages climbers to participate in such activities there.
