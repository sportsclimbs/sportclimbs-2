            <p><b>1. Headline News (6c) *</b>short fingery test-piece via a pleasant compact wall.</p>
            <p><b>2. Heads will Roll (6a) *</b> a long ambling route via a series of cracks and corners to a fine finish on the headwall with the crux being the last move.</p>
            <p><b>3. Razors (6c) </b>fierce technical face climbing above a prominent overlap. Tough though short.</p>
            <p><b>4. Orange Gina (6b+) </b>easy slab and fingery face utilizing the crack on the left when necessary.</p>
            <p><b>5. My My Tsunami E4 6a ** </b>a difficulty shallow groove, BRs, leads to a move left into a superb jamming crack. Hardest through and above the roof</p>
            <p><b> 6. Caesarea (6c+) ** </b>a prominent pillar above the start of the last route gives superb intricate climbing, the crux being getting onto the pillar itself.</p>
            <p><b>7. Viva Les Bulles (6c+) ** </b>the first of two long mega-routes taking a tricky lower bulge, a superb calcite crack, crux bulge and flying finale.</p>
            <p><b>8. Wolves of the Calla (6c+) ** </b>a long, long route beginning via a technical wall, then via a crackline, a bulging calcite wall and steep crack finish. 70m rope essential. Superb. </p>
            <p><b>9. A L'Orange (6c) ** </b>starts just right again and aims for a fine cracked wall and sharp arete finish</p>
            <p><b>10. Pain (6c+) </b>a testing fingery pitch via a thin crack from a ledge at 10m. Lies just to the right of a prominent ramp.</p>
            <p><b>11. Cam Boys E2 5c </b>A good jamming crack springing from the same ledge. Take you Friends.</p>
            <p><b>12. Agony E3 6a * </b>A fine jamming pitch taking the crack above the ledge with the prominent niche towards its top.</p>
            <p><b>13. Hurt (7a) ** </b>Another very fine pitch taking a prominent crackline, juggy overlap and final difficult headwall.</p>
            <p><b>14. Anguish (7a+) * </b>wall and shallow hanging groove to the right. Hard low down with a physical finale.</p>
            <p><b>15. Many Mani Men (6c+) </b>A good little route taking a clean white pillar to a deceptively difficult finish</p>
            <p><b>16. Sisters of Oriza (6c+) **</b> Another potential classic taking an easier lower wall (6b) and a superb overhang wall to finish on an arete out in space.</p>
            <p>The final section of this wall, at right angles to the orange face, gives five easier routes on fine rock.</p>

            <p><b>1. There is No Sanity Claus (6b) * </b>Pleasant climbing via a steep thin crack and technical move on the face above.</p>
            <p><b>2. No Sanity (6c) * </b>the extension above the belay</p>
            <p><b>3. Is there Life after Turkey? (6b) </b>A technical blunt rib and easier slab above to same belay as last route.</p>
            <p><b>4. More Pudding Please (6a) </b>the right side of the corner on fine rock to a ledge, then the easier face above.</p>
            <p><b>5. Flame the Sauce (5) </b>direct via a steep start and calcite slab.</p>
            <p><b>6. Brule (4) </b>obvious crackline</p>
            <p><b>7. Snoozalem (5) </b>the final route on good rock, starting at a slightly higher level.</p>
