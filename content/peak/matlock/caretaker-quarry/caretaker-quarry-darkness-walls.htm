            <p>When walking around from the Take Away Wall a series of walls provides three routes on unusually bubbly rock:<b> Unhappy Hour (6c) </b>a short steep pillar at a higher level with excellent fingery moves, <b>Nappy Hour (5) </b>a bubbly face past a prominent thread and <b>White Tripe (5) </b>a prominent cleaned strip.</p>
            <p>Before reaching the main area of the Darkness Walls is a prominent pillar with three sport routes upon it. These are: </p>
            <p><b>Unlimited Choice (5) </b>a slim pillar just left of the routes marked. Pleasant.</p>
            <p><b>My Furious Tortoise (6b) * </b>the centre of the tower gives fine open climbing</p>
            <p><b>Life Has No Porpoise (6a) </b> the right edge of the tower again with excellent moves.</p>
            <p><b>The Shambling (6b) </b>an isolated pillar to the right which at the moment is dusty and has a few hollow holds.</p>
            <p>All of the routes on the main Darkness Walls have double bolt belays at their base.</p>
            <p><b>1. Dashboard (5) </b>pleasant face route to large flake. A little dusty at present</p>
            <p><b>2. Join the Dots (5) </b>easy pleasant wall, left-hand of three at high level. Worth doing.</p>
            <p><b>3. See Spot Run(6b+) * </b>pleasant central pillar with excellent moves.</p>
            <p><b>4. In a Dash (6c) </b>right-hand pillar, slightly dirty at the start. Worthwhile above.</p>
            <p><b>5. Dashdance (6a) </b>left-hand side of pillar at higher level.</p>
            <p><b>6. Spot's the Difference (6a) </b>right-hand side of prominent pillar with overlap and good climbing. </p>
            <p><b>7. The Clumps (5) * </b>left-hand side of main wall gives classic pitch of easy standard. Better after traffic.</p>
            <p><b>8. A Sharp Intake of Breath (6b) ** </b>central line via faint crackline on wall. A future classic. Sustained.</p>
            <p><b>9. Brain Candy (6b) </b>pleasant face climbing on right edge of wall to joint belay. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b></p>
            <p><b>10. Stinking Rose (6b+) * </b>tricky start through bulge and flake to more fine open face. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b></p>
            <p><b>11. Prickly Pose (6c+) * </b>fine face climbing with a sting in the tail on the slim wall to the right of Stinking Rose. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b></p>
            <p><b>12. Rabbit Proof Fence (6c) ** </b>superb isolated pillar, just worth grade. Will become even better after traffic. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b></p>
            <p><b>13. Brer Faced Cheek (6c) </b>* rightwards line off from Rabbit Proof with good moves and one short difficult section. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b></p>
            <p><b>14. No Country for Old Men (6b) A good pitc</b>h up left-hand side of face after arete start. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b></p>
            <p><b>15. Intolerable Cruelty (7a) *</b> left side of arete to ledge then superb, intricate upper wall with well-defined crux. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b></p>
            <p><b>16. Intake it or Leave it (6b) </b>* a surprisingly good pitch taking the prominent crack in the centre of the wall. Fine climbing. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b></p>
            <p><b>17. Tucker's Grave (7a) ** </b>yet another long fine pitch up the main black wall. Difficulties centred around 8m section. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b></p>
            <p><b>18. Plum Tuckered Out (6b) *** </b>the right-hand side of the main black wall via a crack. Gives a peek at the last route. <b><span class="new">New belay added</span></b> </p>
            <p><b>19. Two Tuck In (6b+) * </b>long pitch via left-hand side of wall to right. Sustained effort, gradually easing.</p>
            <p><b>20. Friar Tuck (6c) </b>well cleaned lower wall past orange patch to thin crack system. Needs more cleaning.</p>
            <p><b>21. Tuck-Shop Brawl (6b+) * </b>branches right off Friar Tuck to take pleasant pillar.</p>
            <p><b>22. Can't Teach 'em Nowt (6c) *</b> moves leftwards from That'll Teach up to a ledge. Then goes left and up via the fine arete.</p>
            <p><b>23. That'll Teach 'em (7a) *</b> highly technical face climb with loads of tricky moves.</p>
            <p><b>24. A Jam's as good as a Rest E3 5c ** </b>the stepped crackline to the right. The belay of the last route can be utilised for a descent.</p>
            <p><b>25. Red Zingers E3 5c ** </b>the prominent twisting crack in the side wall moving left from porthole to finish via a thin crack.</p>
            <p><b>26. Dead Ringer (6c+) **</b> brilliant open wall climbing just over vertical. Sustained and a future classic.</p>
            <p><b>27. Looky Likey (6b+) * </b>a fine open wall climb starting via the right arete of the Dead Ringer wall and climbing slightly rightwards onto the face after a steep start. Fine rock.</p>
            <p>The following routes lie to the right and can be gained from the lower pitch of 'Orchid'or swinging across after doing Looky Likey</p>
            <p><b>28. Flowering Beauty (6b) </b>another good route from the Our Kid's Orchid halfway ledge taking a wall and blunt arete to a fine finish.</p>
            <p><b>29. My Petal (6c) </b>climbs the prominent layback corner and exits with difficulty to a ledge. Trend rightwards to the belay.</p>
            <p><b>30. Mon Dichor (7a) * </b>the thin crack in the severely leaning wall to the right with a short fingery section. Uphill! </p>
            <p><b>31. Our Kid's Orchid (6c,7a) ** </b>A fine two pitch route aiming for the left-hand arete of the chimney. Superb. The lower pitch can now be done in its own right at 6c.</p>
            <p><b>32. Crack of Dawn E2 5a, 5b * </b>takes the scruffy lower crack right of Our Kid's Orchid followed by the impressive straight crack to its right. A superb upper half.</p>
            <p><b>33. DI Fontaine (7a) ** </b>a superb route tucked into the gully wall right of Crack of Dawn and gained by a traverse right from the first pitch of Our Kid's Orchid to a BB with karabiner.</p>
