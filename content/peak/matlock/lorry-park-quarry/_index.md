NB. Most of the routes at Lorry Park are now inaccessible due to ongoing works (from June 2023).

## Character


A very fine wall of hard compact limestone featuring very intense wall climbs intermingled between some impressive (and bolted) cracklines. This quarry sits behind The Boat House pub on the A6 from Matlock to Matlock Bath and is visible from the road set back a few of hundred metres.

In the winter months it suffers a large amount of seepage but once dry provides it tends to stay dry. After heavy rain many routes get wet but this surface water can dry quickly. It faces east and goes into the shade around noon in mid-summer and is thus a good summer venue, despite the outlook.

## Approach

Lorry Park is a short walk from Matlock Town Centre, just off the main road (A6) on the right. There are numerous places to park in streets plus some pay and display carparks etc..

From the town centre follow the main road south under a railway bridge. Just after this is a vehicle entrance with a metal gate on the right. Follow this around the back of the building and continue for a couple of hundred metres to the back of the old lorry park. The routes are on the clean sheet of rock partially obscured by trees. A well used short path leads to the base.
