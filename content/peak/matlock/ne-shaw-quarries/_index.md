These are three little quarried walls within easy reach of Colehill Quarry.

A reappraisal of these neglected quarries lead to a cleaning of the old routes more new ones added. North East is a sun trap with little seepage and will be a good winter venue. The rock is generally good and is as easily accessible as Colehill. Shaw is in the shade by early afternoon and is slower to dry. Work is still ongoing with projects underway in both quarries. Fossil Wall is smaller and shrouded by trees with just 2 routes. Thanks to original pioneer Geoff Hornby for permission to tidy up his old routes and which will now see much more traffic.

## Approach

These quarries are close to [Colehill Quarry](../colehill-quarry/) and the approach and parking is the same as for Colehill.

From Cromford, turn off the A6 and head up the steep hill past Black Rocks and under the old railway bridge. Take the first major right when descending the hill, ominously named Ravenstor Road and at the roundabout/turning area, turn right up the obvious track on the right. This is the same parking as Colehill Quarry. 

There is also parking near the High Peak Trail that is pay and display. All the Quarries are in Stone Centre Complex where access has now been agreed. Please be respectful of other users.

The Stone Centre Caf√© is good value and has excellent coffee and food and makes a good meeting place.
