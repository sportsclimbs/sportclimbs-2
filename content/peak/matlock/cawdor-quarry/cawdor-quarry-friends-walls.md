**1. Mucky Luck (6b+)**  
Pillar with wide crack

**2. Dirty Duck (6a) *★***  
Pleasant left-hand line of three.

**3. Giddy Ant (6b)**  
Centre of initial wall via faint rib and some technical moves.

**4. Chocopotamus (6a) *★***  
Right-hand side of walls gives an easier and better route. Pleasantly sustained.

**5. Fisherman's Friend (7a) *★★***  
Prominent arête taken on left-hand side. Hard low down and hard finale.

**6. Simply Carp (6a) *★***  
Long corner line exiting right at the top to join On Higher Perches.

**7. On Higher Perches (6a+)**  
First of three routes to right of prominent corner. Tricky central section.

**8. Pier Review (6b+) *★***  
Central of three pillar lines. Sustained from 8m ledge at 8m.

**9. Chubb Locked (6a+) *★***  
Crackline moving left to join last route.

**10. High Tench On (6c)**  
Right line via vague arête and prominent yellowy headwall. Fingery.

**11. Ma Pechere (5) *★***  
Excellent central corner line.

**12. Poached Please (6a+) *★***  
Worthwhile companion on right arête.

**13. The Fish Course (6c)**  
Left-hand side of arête to ledge. Steep flaky wall leads to a ledge and tricky finale.

**14. Of Course, the Fish (6b+)**  
Shallow groove and slight left-facing groove to finish of last route.

**15. Carpin' About (6b)**  
Awkward start to ledge followed by pleasant, and surprisingly tricky, face climbing.

**16. Scales of Justice (6a+) *★***  
Steep start with excellent face just left of edge of cave.

**17. Gone Fishing (6c)**  
Isolated pitch at present to finish via prominent headwall. Harder than it looks.

**18. Hook, Line and Sinker(6b)**  
Small arête to start followed by shallow groove systems to top. Pleasant.

**19. Small Fry (6a+)**  
Pillar sandwiched between two grooves to grey face. Good rock.
