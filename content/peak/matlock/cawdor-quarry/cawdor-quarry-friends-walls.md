            <p><b>1. Mucky Luck (6b+)</b> pillar with wide crack</p>
            <p><b>2. Dirty Duck (6a) &starf; </b>pleasant left-hand line of three.</p>
            <p><b>3. Giddy Ant (6b)</b> centre of initial wall via faint rib and some technical moves.</p>
            <p><b>4. Chocopotamus (6a) &starf;</b> right-hand side of walls gives an easier and better route. Pleasantly sustained.</p>
            <p><b>5. Fisherman's Friend (7a) &starf;&starf; </b>prominent arete taken on left-hand side. Hard low down and hard finale.</p>
            <p><b>6. Simply Carp (6a) &starf; </b>long corner line exiting right at the top to join On Higher Perches.</p>
            <p><b>7. On Higher Perches (6a+) </b>first of three routes to right of prominent corner. Tricky central section.</p>
            <p><b>8. Pier Review (6b+) &starf; </b>central of three pillar lines. Sustained from 8m ledge at 8m.</p>
            <p><b>9. Chubb Locked (6a+) &starf; </b>crackline moving left to join last route.</p>
            <p><b>10. High Tench On (6c) </b>right line via vague arete and prominent yellowy headwall. Fingery.</p>
            <p><b>11. Ma Pechere (5) &starf; </b>excellent central corner line.</p>
            <p><b>12. Poached Please (6a+) &starf; </b>worthwhile companion on right arete.</p>
            <p><b>13. The Fish Course (6c) </b>left-hand side of arete to ledge. Steep flaky wall leads to a ledge and tricky finale.</p>
            <p><b>14. Of Course, the Fish (6b+) </b>Shallow groove and slight left-facing groove to finish of last route.</p>
            <p><b>15. Carpin' About (6b) </b>awkward start to ledge followed by pleasant, and surprisingly tricky, face climbing.</p>
            <p><b>16. Scales of Justice (6a+) &starf; </b>steep start with excellent face just left of edge of cave.</p>
            <p><b>17. Gone Fishing (6c) </b>isolated pitch at present to finish via prominent headwall. Harder than it looks.</p>
            <p><b>18. Hook, Line and Sinker(6b) </b>small arete to start followed by shallow groove systems to top. Pleasant.</p>
            <p><b>19. Small Fry (6a+) </b>pillar sandwiched between two grooves to grey face. Good rock.</p>
