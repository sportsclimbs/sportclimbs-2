            <p>An impressive cliff with a wealth of excellent pitches ranging from 5+ to 7a. It's ease of access&mdash;only 2 minutes from the car&mdash;should make it an ideal venue. The crag is well shrouded by trees making it a good place to escape the summer heat but rather dingy on dark cloudy days.</p>

            <p>The rock is mostly solid though Cawdor doesn't get the traffic as the more popular quarries so as in all quarries take care.</p>
