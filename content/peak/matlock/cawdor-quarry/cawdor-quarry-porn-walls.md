{.topo .w100}

**1. Family Ties (6a) *★***  
The long and slightly stepped corner line gives a classic little pitch. 
{.rebolted}

**2. Freaky Friday (6a+) *★***  
Pleasant climbing to shallow corner and steep headwall on right.

**3. Cawdor Nothing (6c+) *★★***  
The centre of the fine wall to the right. Easy to begin, thin and fingery above. Just worth grade. 
{.rebolted}

**4. The Cutting Crew (7a) *★***  
The right-hand side of wall starting via a vague rib to another fingery finale.

**5. Virgin on Porn (6b)**  
Tricky start, the up to ledges. Obvious sharp arête above.

**Pornilicious (6a+) *★***  
The long slim corner line gives a fine pitch.

**6. Boobie Prize (6b) *★***  
The first line on the wall to the right with pleasant sustained climbing and a short hard section. 
{.rebolted}

**7. Breast Stroke (6a+)*★***  
Nice climbing up the shallow groove and crackline. 
{.rebolted}

**8. Breast is Best (6a+) *★***  
The third line on the walls to the right. Very pleasant climbing with sustained interest. Rebolted and recleaned. New belay added

**9. Porn to Run (6b) *★***  
Straightforward climbing behind the large tree to a ledge. Fingery and airy exit. 
{.rebolted}

**10. The Porn Curtain (5)**  
The obvious flake/groove line in the centre of the wall is gained from the right. 
{.rebolted}

**11. Porn Palace (6b+) *★***  
Enjoyable face to ledge. Borehole and headwall provide fitting climax. 
{.rebolted}


**12. Vibrators (6a+)**  
Poor route on right-hand side of wall direct via shallow groove and bulge. 
{.rebolted}

**Porn Again (6a+)**  
The shattered corner to the right.

**13. Five Alive (6a+) *★***  
Right side of rib direct to belay. Fine sustained climbing.

**14. Brazilian Style (6c+) *★★***  
Further right. The left-hand side of the obvious wall. Hard at 3rd BR and excellent above and below. 
{.rebolted}

**15. All Mine (6c+) *★★***  
Even better. Just right, a flake and superb sustained climbing up the wall above. Finish left from last BR. 
{.rebolted}

**16. Yours Truly (6b+) *★***  
Fine sustained climbing up the wall to the right direct to the same belay of All Mine. 
{.rebolted}

**17. Analyze This (6b)**  
The prominent crackline gives a steep and thuggy pitch.

**18. Demon (6c+) *★★***  
Superb face climbing up the centre of the pillar to the right. 
{.rebolted}

**19. Weakling (6b+) *★★***  
The right-hand side of the face provides an equally fine route. 
{.rebolted}
