            <p><b>6. Rust Never Sleeps (6c) &starf;&starf; </b>side wall of arete. Start via 'rusty' cracks and swing right to 3rd BR. Fingery moves, then sustained climbing above. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>

            <p><b>14. Coward (6a+) </b>crack and short arete to ledge. Tight groove and arete above.</p>
