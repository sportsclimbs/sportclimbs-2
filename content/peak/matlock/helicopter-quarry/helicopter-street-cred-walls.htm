            <p>Street Cred Area is the collective name given to a group of buttresses in the right-hand corner of the quarry. There are number of pleasant routes worth seeking out for an evening or as a warm-up before visiting Spectre Sector.</p>

            <h2>Blowing Wind Sector</h2>

            <p>Situated on the right-hand side of the quarry this fine little wall lies above a prominent green carpet of Sphagnum Moss - an ideal place for a family picnic. Gets the sun until 11.30 am in the summer.</p>

            <p><b>1. Back Draught (6b)</b> right-hand line on wall via tricky starting wall. </p>
            <p><b>2. Blowing Wind (6b)</b> central line via upper groove. A tricky start is rewarded with a tricky finish. </p>
            <p><b>3. Guff it and See (6c)</b> short sharp wall direct to belay. Fingery.</p>

            <h2>Street Cred. Sector</h2>

            <p>The name given to the sandy-coloured walls in the top right-hand corner of the area. One classic in the making and a couple of easier routes. Watch out for the Cycle Path!</p>

            <p><b>4. A Hard Shoulder to Cry On (5+)</b> obvious overlapped arete with a hard move to get onto it. </p>
            <p><b>5. Road Rage (6c+)</b> completely innocuous finger crack. Much harder than it looks. </p>
            <p><b>6. Totally Street Cred. (6c+) *</b> centre of sandy-coloured wall gives its best route. Sustained but with no hard moves. </p>
            <p><b>7. The Cycle Path (6a+)</b> pleasant arete above freestanding pinnacle. Much better than looks.</p>

            <h2>Coldfish Sector</h2>

            <p>Three isolated routes, much longer than anything else on these walls. Two very worthwhile and quite tough pitches, the hardest by far in the quarry.</p>

            <div class="topo"><img src="/img/peak/matlock/Halldale-Coldfish-Walls.jpg"></div>

            <p><b>8. Vertical Fish (6c)</b> long vague white pillar standing in isolation. A good long route requires a bit of traffic. </p>
            <p><b>9. Gutted (7b) *</b> very intense and fingery wall through overlap. High in the grade and moves left to join the Coldfish. Mean. </p>
            <p><b>10. The Coldfish (7a+) **</b> the centre of the wall via a hard and technical lower section, a thin crack through an overlap and a much easier upper wall. Well worth seeking out.</p>
