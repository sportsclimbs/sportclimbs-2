            <p><b>1. Black Helicopter Ride (6a)</b> pleasant climbing direct up the black slab. Needs to be dry.</p>
            <p><b>2. First and Last HVS 5a</b> thin crack to top, or belay on left.</p>
            <p><b>3. Unblackened (6a) </b> &starf; left arete of face and upper slab.</p>
            <p><b>4. False Idol (6c) </b> shallow groove and short headwall to join God is Good.</p>
            <p><b>5. God is Good (6c) &starf;&starf;</b> an angled face climbing aiming just right of the hanging corner. Excellent.</p>
            <p><b>6. Out There (6c) </b> Finishes via hanging arete.</p>
            <p><b>7. Up There (6c) </b>direct line through steeped overlaps above God.</p>
            <p><b>8. The Spectre (6b+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> straightforward face to hanging corner. Arete and then wide crack.</p>
            <p><b>9. Dark Side of the Room (7a+) &starf;</b> steady slab and then double roof stack. Desperate onto upper wall.</p>
            <p><b>10. Burning Spirits (6b+) &starf;&starf;</b> the obvious central line via roof and upper crack/groove.</p>
            <p><b>11. Southern Discomfort (6c+) &starf;&starf;</b> classic stuff. Fine lower wall, fingery roof and fine headwall.</p>
            <p><b>12. Spooktakula (7a+) &starf;&starf;</b> a very fine pitch through the centre of the strip roof and via the upper face.</p>
            <p><b>13. Lick Yours (7a) &starf;</b> final line of slab. Hard roof and superb face above. Hollow just below overlap.</p>
            <p><b>14. Ghost Story (6b+)</b> the vague pillar at the left side of the wall. Open face towards the top.</p>
            <p><b>15. The Bible Belt (6b+) </b>diagonal crossing of face beneath overlaps to belay on God.</p>
