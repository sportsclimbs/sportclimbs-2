Around to the left of the main wall is a compact wall of very good rock with three worthwhile routes. From left to right these area: **Ximinez(6c), Biggles (6c+)** and **Fang (6a)**.

**1. Rampant Rabbit (6c+)**  
Easy to ledge with desperate technical sequence to gain belay.

**2. Buzz Bunny (7a)**  
Easy to final hard wall.

**3. Dolphin Delight (6b)**  
Follow the thin crackline with a hard finish for the short - 6b+?

**4. Pearl Driver (6b+)**  
Fingery start then jugs and easier headwall. Easier for tall.

**5. Eager Beaver (6c) *★***  
Another very fingery start then fine climbing past the ledge to the top.

**6. Twist and Shout (6b)**  
The warm up. Right-hand side of arête to ledge, then headwall left of block. Good.

**7. Marsh Mellowed (6c)**  
Bulging start and ramp followed by technical wall with difficult to spot holds.

**8. Swamp-Fest (6b+) *★***  
Excellent sustained climbing up the centre of the orange wall.

**9. Glug, Glug, Glug (6b)**  
Thin crack above a ledge with some long reaches.

**10. Open Water (6c+)**  
Straightforward wall above ledge to a desperate finale on an undercut.

**11. Final Drips (6b)**  
Easier wall and difficult thin crack.
