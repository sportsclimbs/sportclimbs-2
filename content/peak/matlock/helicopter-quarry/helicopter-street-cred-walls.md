Street Cred Area is the collective name given to a group of buttresses in the right-hand corner of the quarry. There are number of pleasant routes worth seeking out for an evening or as a warm-up before visiting Spectre Sector.

Blowing Wind Sector
-------------------

Situated on the right-hand side of the quarry this fine little wall lies above a prominent green carpet of Sphagnum Moss - an ideal place for a family picnic. Gets the sun until 11.30 am in the summer.

**1. Back Draught (6b)**  
Right-hand line on wall via tricky starting wall.

**2. Blowing Wind (6b)**  
Central line via upper groove. A tricky start is rewarded with a tricky finish.

**3. Guff it and See (6c)**  
Short sharp wall direct to belay. Fingery.

Street Cred. Sector
-------------------

The name given to the sandy-coloured walls in the top right-hand corner of the area. One classic in the making and a couple of easier routes. Watch out for the Cycle Path!

**4. A Hard Shoulder to Cry On (5+)**  
Obvious overlapped arête with a hard move to get onto it.

**5. Road Rage (6c+)**  
Completely innocuous finger crack. Much harder than it looks.

**6. Totally Street Cred. (6c+) *★***  
Centre of sandy-coloured wall gives its best route. Sustained but with no hard moves.

**7. The Cycle Path (6a+)**  
Pleasant arête above freestanding pinnacle. Much better than looks.

Coldfish Sector
---------------

Three isolated routes, much longer than anything else on these walls. Two very worthwhile and quite tough pitches, the hardest by far in the quarry.

**8. Vertical Fish (6c)**  
Long vague white pillar standing in isolation. A good long route requires a bit of traffic.

**9. Gutted (7b) *★***  
Very intense and fingery wall through overlap. High in the grade and moves left to join the Coldfish. Mean.

**10. The Coldfish (7a+) *★★***  
The centre of the wall via a hard and technical lower section, a thin crack through an overlap and a much easier upper wall. Well worth seeking out.
