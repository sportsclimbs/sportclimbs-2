            <p>Around to the left of the main wall is a compact wall of very good rock with three worthwhile routes. From left to right these area: <b>Ximinez(6c), Biggles (6c+) </b>and<b> Fang (6a)</b></p>
            <p><b>1. Rampant Rabbit (6c+) </b>Easy to ledge with desperate technical sequence to gain belay</p>
            <p><b>2. Buzz Bunny (7a) </b>easy to final hard wall.</p>
            <p><b>3. Dolphin Delight (6b) </b>follow the thin crackline with a hard finish for the short - 6b+?</p>
            <p><b>4. Pearl Driver (6b+) </b>fingery start then jugs and easier headwall. Easier for tall.</p>
            <p><b>5. Eager Beaver (6c) * </b>another very fingery start then fine climbing past the ledge to the top.</p>
            <p><b>6. Twist and Shout (6b) </b>the warm up. Right-hand side of arete to ledge, then headwall left of block. Good.</p>
            <p><b>7. Marsh Mellowed (6c) </b>bulging start and ramp followed by technical wall with difficult to spot holds.</p>
            <p><b>8. Swamp-Fest (6b+) * </b>excellent sustained climbing up the centre of the orange wall.</p>
            <p><b>9. Glug, Glug, Glug (6b) </b>thin crack above a ledge with some long reaches.</p>
            <p><b>10. Open Water (6c+) </b>straightforward wall above ledge to a desperate finale on an undercut.</p>
            <p><b>11. Final Drips (6b) </b>easier wall and difficult thin crack</p>
