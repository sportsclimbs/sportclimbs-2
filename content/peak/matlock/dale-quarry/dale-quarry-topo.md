The first routes start on the white rock just to the left of the main slab.


**1. Steampunk (7b+)** &starf;&starf;  
Start at a large undercut flake left of the corner and climb up via two opposing boreholes through the bulges and overhangs above.

**2. Last Act of Defiance (7a+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;     
Climb the obvious corner line above a hole. There are multiple finishes:  
1.  the original route finished at the top of the groove (7a).  
2.  the original extension swings out left and up into a short groove of Steampunk and finishes up that.  
3.  as *b* but from the base of the groove span out R to jugs and go straight up from there, this is a minor and slightly easier version than *b*.  
4.  from the top of the corner finish up *Weather Underground*. Probably the best finish.  
5.  move R from the top of the groove and finish up *Runaway Train* (7a?)

**3. Weather Underground (7a+)** &starf; climbs the arete R of  *Last Act..* and joins that route below the bulges. Make the span out L as for that route but then span back R to a jug and BR. Continue up to join the RH finish of *Last Act*. Low in the grade. Needs two 12mm bolt hangers for the first two bolts though can be climbed with wires over the studs.

**4. Runaway Van (6c)** &starf;  
Start up a short arete and friable looking sidepull to gain the flat wall. Continue through the bulges to finish up the smooth headwall. High first bolt. (Rebolted)

**5. Project** The leftmost line on the slab following glue in bolts.

**6. Underground Resistance (7b+)** &starf;&starf;  
Line of bolts up the slab left of Handy Wallhole to the grassy ledge. (20m)

**7. Handy Wallhole (6c+)** &starf;&starf;  
Climbs up the huge hole with the chain and continues up to a ledge and the slab above to the top of the crag. (30m).

**8. Pop Art (6b+)** &starf;&starf;  
Climbs up the first 4 bolts of Handy Borehole before traversing into, and finishing up, Ascent Given.

**9.  Ascent Given (7c)** &starf;&starf;  
Hard climbing on the lower section gives way to a much easier top half. (30m).

**Ascend the Underground (7c+)** &starf;  
A link-up. Starting up Ascent Given, traverse into Handy Wallhole, going up one move then move L into Underground Resistance at the white square and finish up this.

**10. Autist or Artist? (7b+)** &starf;&starf;  
Follow the bolts R of *Ascent Given*.

**11. Higher Ominous Bush (7b)** &starf;&starf;  
The short wall on the right side of the main slab. 5BRs. Finishes on the jug above the belay. (10m).

At the RH end of the wall, there is  a steep slope with an in situ rope. From the top of this is a line of bolts that splits into two above a ledge. These two routes are:

**12. Rose of Avalanche (6b+)** &starf; up the wall to tree stumps then take the LH line of bolts.

**13. Guns and Roses (6b)** &starf; takes the RH line from the tree stumps (Retrobolted 2020)
