These small walls, about 10m high, are located just to the North of Colehill Quarry. 

You can either approach from the same parking as Colehill Quarry (Ravenstor Road) and follow the path to the L of Colehill Quarry.

Alternatively, when coming from Cromford, take the new road on the right before Ravenstor Road. Park just inside in at parking area. Follow a track onto some scrubland. The walls are on the right just behind some trees.
