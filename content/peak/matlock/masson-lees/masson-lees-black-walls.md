**1. The Cows, The Cows (7a+) *★★***  
The classic of the wall starting via the right arête of the prominent groove. Intricate low down. 
{.rebolted}

**2. Masson Accomplished (7a+) *★★★***  
A fabulous new route taking the full height of the wall with a technical start, fingery face climbing and a steep, strenuous finale.
{.rebolted}

**3. Unveiled (7a) *★***  
A new line high in the grade with fingery moves low down and a long reach to finish.

**4. Seventh Time Lucky (7b) *★***  
An even harder start to easier climbing and a long reach to gain the prominent scar in the face. A little disjointed.

**5. Plucked (7b+) *★***  
The direct finish. High in grade. 
{.rebolted}

**6. Never to Rise (7a+) *★★***  
A difficult start via a faint rib leads to fine technical face climbing and a stopper finish. Harder for the short. 
{.rebolted}

**7. Resurrection (7b+) *★★***  
The inevitable superb extension to Never to Rise with sustained and fingery climbing. Can take a while to dry out.

**8. Long Black Veil (7a+) *★★★***  
The centre of the black wall starting via a flake. Sustained and very fingery with superb moves. 
{.rebolted}

**9. Fuck Your Gods (7a) *★★***  
An even better pitch with sustained technical interest on the wall to the left. Fingery. 
{.rebolted}

**10. Cattle Mutilation Expedition (6c+) *★***  
Superb sustained face climbing with a tricky start and hard finish. Low in grade or 6c if finished on right. 
{.rebolted}

**11. Masson Impossible (6c)**  
The technical black face with hard moves at half height. Slightly contrived.

**12. The Numbers Game (6b)**  
A shallow groove line with a technical middle section.

**13. Lifelong Learning (5)**  
Another shallow groove line with one tricky move at half height.

**14. Closing Chapter (6b)**  
The technical face with one hard technical move.

**15. Opening Salvo (6b+) *★***  
Pleasant face climbing slightly rightwards to steep finale. Good climbing.

**16. Last Offence (6b+)**  
The slim newly cleaned wall with a few stretches.

**17. Better Luck Next Time Steve (6b+)**  
A short technical wall with boulder problem start and steep finish.
