            <p> <b>1. The Cows, The Cows (7a+) **</b> the classic of the wall starting via the right arete of the prominent groove. Intricate low down. <span class="new">Rebolted.</span></p>
            <p> <b>2. Masson Accomplished (7a+) *** </b> a fabulous new route taking the full height of the wall with a technical start, fingery face climbing and a steep, strenuous finale. <span class="new">Rebolted.</b> </p>
            <p> <b>3. Unveiled (7a) * </b> a new line high in the grade with fingery moves low down and a long reach to finish. </p>
            <p> <b>4. Seventh Time Lucky (7b) * </b> An even harder start to easier climbing and a long reach to gain the prominent scar in the face. A little disjointed. </p>
            <p><b>5. Plucked (7b+) * </b>is the direct finish. High in grade. <span class="new">Rebolted</span> </p>
            <p> <b>6. Never to Rise (7a+) ** </b> A difficult start via a faint rib leads to fine technical face climbing and a stopper finish. Harder for the short. <span class="new">Rebolted.</span></p>
            <p><b>7. Resurrection (7b+) **</b> the inevitable superb extension to Never to Rise with sustained and fingery climbing. </p>
            <p> <b>8. Long Black Veil (7a+) *** </b> the centre of the black wall starting via a flake. Sustained and very fingery with superb moves. <span class="new">Rebolted.</span> </p>
            <p> <b>9. Fuck Your Gods (7a) ** </b> an even better pitch with sustained technical interest on the wall to the left. Fingery. <span class="new">Rebolted.</span> </p>
            <p> <b>10. Cattle Mutilation Expedition (6c+) *</b> superb sustained face climbing with a tricky start and hard finish. Low in grade or 6c if finished on right. <span class="new"> rebolted.</span> </p>

            <p> <b>11. Masson Impossible (6c) </b> technical black face with hard moves at half height. Slightly contrived.</p>
            <p> <b>12. The Numbers Game (6b) </b> shallow groove line technical middle section.</p>
            <p> <b>13. Lifelong Learning (5)</b> shallow groove line with one tricky move at half height.</p>
            <p> <b>14. Closing Chapter (6b) </b> technical face with one hard technical move.</p>
            <p> <b>15. Opening Salvo (6b+) *</b> pleasant face climbing slightly rightwards to steep finale. Good climbing.</p>
            <p> <b>16. Last Offence (6b+) </b> the slim newly cleaned wall with a few stretches.</p>
            <p> <b>17. Better Luck Next Time Steve (6b+) </b> short technical wall with boulder problem start and steep finish.</p>
