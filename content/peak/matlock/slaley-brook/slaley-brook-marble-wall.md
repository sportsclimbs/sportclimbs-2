**1. Dog Tooth Wall (6c)** surprisingly pleasant and fingery wall.

**2. Shattered (6c+)** &starf;&starf; the final route taking the steep hidden wall around corner. Thuggy, direct and fine

**3. Unstained (6b)** side wall of face into chimney exiting left and up onto arete.

**4. Calcite Consequence (6a+)** &starf;  short tricky arete, then groove in arete above. Good warm up. Belay renewed.

**5. The Calc Spur (6c+)** &starf;&starf; the shallow hanging scoop and wall above prominent flake. Belay renewed.

**6. Brandy Snaps (7b)** &starf;&starf; another harder classic taking the centre of the smooth face. Hard and bold at top. Belay renewed.

**7. The Calcspa (6b)** &starf;&starf; weird and wonderful calcite crackline. Hard start.

**8. Frozen Moment (6c)** &starf;&starf; fine and sustained wall climbing.

**9. Paneful (6b+)** starts via 'runnel' to pleasant wall.

**10. In the Flow (6c+)** &starf;  shallow groove and bulge to left then black calcite face.

**11. Glass Back (6b)** tricky start via groove and crack to finish leftwards.

**12. Mirrored (7a)** &starf;  black wall, hard low down and easy off towards the top.

**13. Born Slippy (6c+)** &starf;  thin crack to bold upper wall. A good little face route.

**14. That Shard (6a)** right-hand side of wall starting via wide crack to scoop. Exit left.

**15. Crystal Maths (6a)** pleasant face climb on very right-hand side of wall.
