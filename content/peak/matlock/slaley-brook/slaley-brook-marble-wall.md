**1. Dog Tooth Wall (6c)**  
Surprisingly pleasant and fingery wall.

Side wall of face into chimney exiting left and up onto arete.

**4. Calcite Consequence (6a+)** &starf;   
Short tricky arete, then groove in arete above. Good warm up. Belay renewed.

The shallow hanging scoop and wall above prominent flake. Belay renewed.
