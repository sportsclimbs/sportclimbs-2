**1\. Sandstone Story (6b+)**  
Short tricky wall and pleasant climbing direct above.

**2\. Sandsite (6b+)**  
Next line via scoop. Keep direct on the line. Can be dusty.

**3\. In the End (7b) ★★★**  
The first of a pair of mega routes taking the obvious hanging flat wall. Magnificent climbing.

**4\. Raven Calling (7a) ★★**  
Vague wall and arete to the right with a magnificent new finish up the flake and impressive headwall above. Fine climbing.

**5\. Duck Attack (6a+)**  
The crack and groove line gives a worthy pitch above the blocks.

**6\. Pinching the Bird Pooh (7a)**  
The wall to the right with tricky moves at half height and to gain the belay

**7\. Prowl Owl (7a)**  
Another mega route taking the walls and overlap to the right finishing via a slim white pillar. Half-height lower off/belay. 80m rope needed for whole route. The start still needs care and a little more cleaning.

**8\. Too Monsterosity (7a) ★★**  
A truly massive route and the longest sport route in the Peak District. 18 clips. Just follow the line. With care it can be climbed with a 60m rope followed by a two stage lower off via the lower off at half height. An 80m rope is required to get to the ground in one though.

**9\. Godzilla (7b) ★**  
A left-hand variant from the second bolt above the mid-height abseil station on Monsterosity. Easier for those with a big reach.
