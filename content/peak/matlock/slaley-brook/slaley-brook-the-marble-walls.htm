            <p> <b>1. Crystal Maths (6a) </b> pleasant face climb on very right-hand side of wall.</p>
            <p> <b>2. That Shard (6a)</b> right-hand side of wall starting via wide crack to scoop. Exit left.</p>
            <p> <b>3. Born Slippy (6c+) *</b> thin crack to bold upper wall. A good little face route.</p>
            <p> <b>4. Mirrored (7a) * </b>black wall, hard low down and easy off towards the top.</p>
            <p> <b>5. Glass Back (6b)</b> tricky start via groove and crack to finish leftwards.</p>
            <p> <b>6. In the Flow (6c+) *</b> shallow groove and bulge to left then black calcite face.</p>
            <p> <b>7. Paneful (6b+)</b> starts via 'runnel' to pleasant wall.</p>
            <p> <b>8. Frozen Moment (6c) </b>** fine and sustained wall climbing.</p>
            <p> <b>9. The Calcspa (6b) **</b> weird and wonderful calcite crackline. Hard start.</p>
            <p> <b>10. Brandy Snaps (7b) **</b> another harder classic taking the centre of the smooth face. Hard and bold at top. <span class="new">Belay renewed.</span> </p>
            <p> <b>11. The Calc Spur (6c+) ** </b> the shallow hanging scoop and wall above prominent flake. <span class="new">Belay renewed.</span> </p>
            <p> <b>12. Calcite Consequence (6a+) *</b> short tricky arete, then groove in arete above. Good warm up. <span class="new">Belay renewed.</span> </p>
            <p> <b>13. Unstained (6b)</b> side wall of face into chimney exiting left and up onto arete. </p>
            <p> <b>14. Shattered (6c+) **</b> the final route taking the steep hidden wall around corner. Thuggy, direct and fine </p>
            <p> <b>15. Dog Tooth Wall (6c) </b> surprisingly pleasant and fingery wall.</p>
