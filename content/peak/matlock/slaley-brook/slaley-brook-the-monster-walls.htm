            <p><b>1. Sandstone Story (6b+) </b> short tricky wall and pleasant climbing direct above.</p>
            <p><b>2. Sandsite (6b+)</b> next line via scoop. Keep direct on the line. Can be dusty.</p>
            <p><b>3. In the End (7b) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> the first of a pair of mega routes taking the obvious hanging flat wall. Magnificent climbing.  </p>
            <p><b>4. Raven Calling (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> vague wall and arete to the right with a magnificent new finish up the flake and impressive headwall above. Fine climbing.</p>
            <p><b>5. Duck Attack (6a+)</b> the crack and groove line gives a worthy pitch above the blocks. </p>
            <p><b>6. Pinching the Bird Pooh (7a) </b>the wall to the right with tricky moves at half height and to gain the belay</p>
            <p><b>7. Prowl Owl (7a)</b> another mega route taking the walls and overlap to the right finishing via a slim white pillar. Half-height lower off/belay. 80m rope needed for whole route. The start still needs care and a little more cleaning.</p>
            <p><b>8. Too Monsterosity (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> massive route, biggest sport route in Britain. 18 clips. Just follow the line. Rigged for 60m rope to just below half-height lower off. 80m rope required to get to the ground in one..</p>
            <p><b>9. Godzilla (7b) &starf; </b>left-hand variant from the second bolt above the mid-height abseil station on Monsterosity. Easier for those with a big reach.</p>
