This is the area of wall on the far right-hand side of the crag and facing into the quarry. It has a small selection of easier grade sport routes.

**1\. It's A Deal (5)**  
Slightly rightwards through conglomerate

**2\. It's A Steal (5+)**  
Blunt rib start then faint cracks on left

**3\. It's Been Emotional (6b)**  
Short wall and fine headwall. Good.

**4\. Bobby's Bits (6b)**  
Tricky start, then rightwards via flake

**5\. Lock, Stock and two Smoking Barrels (6a)**  
Flake, short wall and steep finale.

**6\. Soup (6a+)**  
Pleasant face climbing with one long move.

**7\. Succulent Rib (6c) *â˜…***  
Blunt rib with tricky start and fingery finish.

**8\. Tubby Tommy (6b)**  
Another vague rib with awkward moves to reach the belay slightly right.

**9\. Tasty Morsels (6a)**  
Pleasant climbing via the diagonal line.
