            <p>The routes are from left to right.</p>

            <p><b>1. L'Esprit de l'Escalier (7a) *</b> the first route right of the ivy climbs the steep wall via staple bolts.</p>
            <p><b>2. Precariat (7a+) **</b> A fine route up that starts via a mono. Originally graded 6c!!</p>
            <p><b>3. Red Shoes at the Drugstore (7a) **</b> a fine wall climb that finishes over the roof at the top of the crag. A long draw for the final bolt is useful.</p>
            <p><b>4. Blue Valentine (7a+) **</b> take the fine wall starting at the tree</p>
            <p><b>5. Dancing with Mr D original (E4 / 7a?) **</b> climbs the immaculate groove and pulls over roof L of the bolted line and finishes at the top of the crag. Currently some gear required for the top.</p>
            <p><b>6. Dancing with Mr D direct (7a+) *</b> from below the roof swing up and R following the bolts to a flat shelf on the lip. Finish with a long lock off to grab the belay.</p>
            <p>The next two routes skirt either side of a huge detached shield of rock. How long this will last is anyone's guess.</p>
            <p><b>7. Prospero's Buoux (6c+) *</b> Start up Dancing with Mr D but follow the bolt line out right. Take a couple of extra draws as one of the new bolts is difficult to clip. Possibly some loose blocks on this now. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>8. Bad Liver Broken Heart (6c+) *</b> From the ledge undercut up rightwards and to gain the wall. The finishing jug can be hard to spot.</p>
            <p><b>9. I'll Shoot The Moon (6b) *</b> The obvious groove can be gained directly or more athletically from the left.</p>
            <p><b>10. The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me) (6c)</b> Fingery climbing up the wall. Don't stray too far left onto to the loose rock.</p>
            <p><b>11. Bend Aid (E4 6a) *</b> either a trad route, a very run out sport route or perhaps a trad route that wants to be a sport route. Take your pick, currently there are 2 bolts.</p>
            <p><b>12. Snails Ate My Lampshade (6b+) *</b> another sparsely bolted route but can be lead with just the 3 bolts. As a trad route it's grade is E3 6a. </p>
            <p><b>13. Fast Women (7a+) *</b> climb the bulge to a break. Traverse right to a sidepull and use this to reach the headwall above.</p>
            <p><b>14. I Should Coco (7a)</b> Worthwhile. Recently <span class="new">rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>15. Slow Horses (7a+) *</b> Steep climbing on big holds. Careful routefinding in the upper section required.</p>
            <p><b>16. Unreliable Sources (7a) **</b> the final route climbs a bulge into a niche. High in the grade.</p>
