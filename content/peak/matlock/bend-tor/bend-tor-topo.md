No topo just yet but you can figure out the routes from the descriptions below.

The routes are from left to right.
{.csa}


**1. L'Esprit de l'Escalier (7a) *★***  
The first route right of the ivy climbs the steep wall via staple bolts.

**2. Precariat (7a+) *★★***  
A fine route up that starts via a mono. Originally graded 6c!!

**3. Red Shoes at the Drugstore (7a) *★★***  
A fine wall climb that finishes over the roof at the top of the crag. A long draw for the final bolt is useful.

**4. Blue Valentine (7a+) *★★***  
Take the fine wall starting at the tree.

**5. Dancing with Mr D original (E4 / 7a?) *★★***  
Climbs the immaculate groove and pulls over roof L of the bolted line and finishes at the top of the crag. Currently some gear required for the top.

**6. Dancing with Mr D direct (7a+) *★***  
From below the roof swing up and R following the bolts to a flat shelf on the lip. Finish with a long lock off to grab the belay.

The next two routes skirt either side of a huge detached shield of rock. How long this will last is anyone's guess.

**7. Prospero's Buoux (6c+) *★***  
Start up Dancing with Mr D but follow the bolt line out right. Take a couple of extra draws as one of the new bolts is difficult to clip. Possibly some loose blocks on this now.

**8. Bad Liver Broken Heart (6c+) *★***  
From the ledge undercut up rightwards and to gain the wall. The finishing jug can be hard to spot.

**9. I'll Shoot The Moon (6b) *★***  
The obvious groove can be gained directly or more athletically from the left.

**10. The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me) (6c)**  
Fingery climbing up the wall. Don't stray too far left onto to the loose rock.

**11. Bend Aid (E4 6a) *★***  
Either a trad route, a very run out sport route or perhaps a trad route that wants to be a sport route. Take your pick, currently there are 2 bolts.

**12. Snails Ate My Lampshade (6b+) *★***  
Another sparsely bolted route but can be lead with just the 3 bolts. As a trad route it's grade is E3 6a.

**13. Fast Women (7a+) *★***  
Climb the bulge to a break. Traverse right to a sidepull and use this to reach the headwall above.

**14. I Should Coco (7a)**  
Anothe worthwhile route.

**15. Slow Horses (7a+) *★***  
Steep climbing on big holds. Careful routefinding in the upper section required.

**16. Unreliable Sources (7a) *★★***  
The final route climbs a bulge into a niche. High in the grade.
