When walking in from Cressbrook Mill This is the first section of the cliff, easily recognizable by the roof of *Rubicon*.

**13. Truly Awesome (7a+) ★**  
The left-hand side of the roofs to the right with a definite crux sequence. Finish via the lip of Rubicon. A direct finish is possible though very eliminate (7b).  
*F.A. Ian Dunn 1991*

**14. Rubicon (7a) ★★**  
The impressive roof via the obvious crack. Jugs and long pulls. Bring your muscles.  
*F.A. Tom Proctor, Geoff Birtles 1979*

**15. Zeitgeist (7b) ★**  
Not quite so fine to the right and tough through the bulges  
*F.A. Ian Dunn 1991*

**16. The Bomb is Coming (7a) ★**  
Powerful moves up the hanging arete. Vegetated exit to a bolt belay.  
*F.A. Paul Mitchell 1983*

**Direct Hit (7b) ★**  
A better and harder version of The Bomb. Follow that route to the big hold then move left to pull over the lip to the R of Rubicion.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 2017*

**17. Project**  
The bulge to the right with a bit of 'yarding'.

**18. Small but Perfectly Formed (7a+)**  
The micro route to the right with a hard move to reach the jug above the belay bolt.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 2010*

**Skippy the Bush Kangeroo Weird (E3 6c)**  
A very short route marked by short thin crack.

**No Thug No Jug (7b)** ★  
Start from the *Rubicon* belay ledge and traverse the break left into *Zeke*. From there it climbs the slight groove above, a few feet R of Zeke's finish.  
*F.A. Andy Barker 1988*

**Cruising the Seven Seas (7c)**  
Continue the traverse of *No Thug* all the way to the belay on *Last But Not Least*.  
*F.A. Chris Plant 1989*
