The leftmost route on the crag.
{.mt0}

**2. The Workhouse (7a+)**

**3. Poorlaw (6c+)**

**4. A Major Moment (7a)**  
Start below two opposite facing blocky flakes just above the first bolt. Move L on the break above before going up through the bulge and L to finish.

**5. Supplementary Benefit (7a+) *★***  
Start up the smooth slab.

**6. Incapacity Benefit (7a+) *★★***  
High in the grade.

**7. The Dole 1989 (7b+) *★***  
Finishes below the top roof. Carrying on over the roof gives **The Enterprise Allowance Finish (7c+)**

**8. Yorkshire 8b (8a) *★***

**9. Ape Index (8b+) *★***  
Climbs the wall and bulges R of the previous route.

**10. The Weakling (7c+) *★★***  
Another double roof route.

**11. The Wee Cling (7c)**  
Climbs *Brachiation Dance* to the notch then goes up and left to finish up the Weakling.

**12. Brachiation Dance (7a+) *★★***  
Takes a line through bulges via the prominent notch. Belay may be missing so jump off and lower of the last bolt.

**13. The Free Monster (8a) *★★★***  
Originally named *The Tea Monster* until the bolt on hold was removed.

**14. The Auctioneer (8a+)**

**15. Rumble in the Jungle (8a+) *★★★***

**16. Monsterosity (8b) *★★★***  
Starts up Rumble to the big flake then heads leftwards to finish up Alabatrossity. Possibly harder since loss of holds.

**17. Barbarossity (8b) *★★★***  
A direct finish to the last route climbing directly through the final roof between Rumble in the Jungle and Albatrossity.

**18. Albatrossity (8a+) *★★★***  
As the name implies a big span is required. Maybe harder for smaller climbers.

**19. Superfly (8a+) *★★***

**20. Superosity (8a+) *★★***  
A fully independent line despite the name.

**21. Eclipsed (8a+) *★★***

**22. The Disillusioned Glue Machine (8a) *★★***

**23. Empire Burlesque (7c+) *★***  
Shares the start with the last route branching out R from the horizontal break.

**25. Goldcrest (8a) *★***  
Shares start with the last route up to the break.

**26. Sirius (7c+) *★***

**27. Attila the Hun (7a+)**

**28. Catch the Rainbow (6b+)**  
The rightmost route is also the easiest. No belay so climb/jump down and lower off of the last bolt.
