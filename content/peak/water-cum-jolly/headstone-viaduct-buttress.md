{.topo}

Technically this crag is not part of the Water Cum Jolly but it's close enough to be included being only about a mile downstream from Rubicon.
{.csa}

This fine buttress has only 3 routes so far and was developed by Paul Freeman who climbed Blockbuster and the Blocky Road to Ruin, and Mark Pretty who climbed the extremely steep _The Blocky Horror Show_ in 2013. The climbing is short, steep and physical on good holds and despite the names the rock is good quality. All the routes are worth doing.
{.csa}

Aspect
------

The crag faces SE and is rarely wet, even in the winter.
{.csa}

Approach
--------

The crag is a several hundred metres downstream of the spectacular viaduct at Monsal Head.
{.csa}

Go down the hill from Monsal Head in the direction of Rubicon Wall (NW) and when the road flattens out park on the left. (-1.729252 53.243595)
{.csa}

Walk back along the road take the public footpath past a house to cross the river via a footbridge. Follow the path uphill to join the Monsal trail, a track of a disused railway line. At the viaduct go through a gate on the R and follow the path down. After 300m or so the crag is visible on the hill on the right. A steep path leads up to the crag.

The Routes
----------

{.topo}

From left to right:
{.csa}

**1. Blockbuster (6c+)**  
This takes the steep wall heading up rightwards. A stick to clip the first bolt may be helpful.
{.mt0}

**2. The Blocky Horror Show (7b+)**  
An unlikely looking line straight up the extremely steep, bulging wall.

**3. The Blocky Road to Ruin (7a) *★***  
The steep L facing corner provides a brutal, gritstonesque tussel on jams, fingerlocks, undercuts and jugs.
