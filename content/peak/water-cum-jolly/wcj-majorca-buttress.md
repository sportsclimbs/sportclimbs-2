This is a small previously developed crag that has been brought up to date by the re-bolting of its existing routes and the addition of a handful more. It is short (max 15m), has good compact rock and provides a number of technical and fingery pitches.

## Approach

Cross the bridge at the eastern end of Rubicon Wall and follow the path up some limestone steps. As they end, take the path on the right which contours the hillside above the cliffs and emerges at a stile just before the end of a railway tunnel. Just past the 'stile' take a vague path back down rightwards and contour back under the cliffs, past the imposing Crunch Buttress, to the foot of the wall.
