This fine little buttress has 3 sport routes and and is is just a few minutes from Central Buttress in Water Cum Jolly. It was originally developed as an aid climbing venue in 1959. These routes were freed as trad routes in the 1970s. The sport routes were added more recently by Paul Freeman and Mark Pretty and take independent lines.

## Aspect

The crag faces north and is shady most of the time making it a pleasant summer venue.

## Approach

From the left end of Central Buttress continue along the path past several small crags. The left most of these is easily recognizable by the prominent horizontal roof at 10 metres.
