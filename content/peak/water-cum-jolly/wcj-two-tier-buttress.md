## Introduction

A super little crag with four good routes on immaculate rock. Although short they are well worth doing and may be suitable as warm ups for greater things or as an afternoon/evening venue. They seep in the winter and get only morning sunshine.

## Access

A little tricky. From Cressbrook Mill, go through the mill to the weir and cross the bridge before Rubicon Wall wall. After a few rock steps, turn right and follow the path above the cliffs, over a fence after 5 minutes and down onto the railway track. Follow this and just before the next tunnel pass to its right and follow a vague path along the cliff tops, over a fence and above The Cornice to fine a lone, stout Hawthorn tree - the crag is below this. Continue for another 50m and a vague path descends to a grass banking. Turn right and the cliff becomes evident.

An easy start leads to a fine hanging rib.

**4. Under-Tiered (6c)**  
The right-hand line has a devious crux and pocketed slab above.
