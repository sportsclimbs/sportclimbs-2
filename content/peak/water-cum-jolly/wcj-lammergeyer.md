## Approach

Park and approach as for Rubicon Wall. Walk past Rubicon Wall and continue upstream for several hundred metres until level with Moat Buttress on the other side of the water. Lammergeyer Buttress is up in the trees about 50 feet above the main path, clearly visible in winter but harder to spot when the leaves are on the trees. Two vague paths go up to the crag, one at either end.

## Character

This diminutive wall is no more than 10m high but none of the routes are easy. This is quintessence of the Peak limestone style: short, fingery, hard to read, invisible low friction holds and powerful.

The crag was never popular as a trad climbing venue but has seen much more activity in recent years after routes have been rebolted or retrobolted.

**1. Recycle or Die (6b+)** a short route even by Lammergeyer standards. A hard crux leads up to the top but there's no belay so climb or jump down the last bolt and lower off. The crag's easiest and probably worst route.

**2. Aquarian Warriors (E5 6b)**

**3. The Lammergeyer Twins (E5 6b)** The first route on the wall gives the buttress it's name. First climbed in 1983 but now never climbed. Waiting for some bolts.

**4. As Summers Die (7a+)**

**5. Easy's Gettin' Harder (7c)**

**6. One Way Reflection (7a)** &starf;

**7. Pinch an Inch (7b+)**  &starf;

**Final Apocalypse (7a+)**  &starf; A powerful start leads to only slightly easier climbing above. The most popular route on the wall.

**Mr Puniverse (7a+)** A fierce start via a sloper leads to easier climbing above. There is no belay so most finish at jugs by the final bolt.

**The Myth of Masculinity (7a+)** Climb *Mr Puniverse* but break out right up the bulging wall. Needs rebolting.

**The Ego has Landed (7b+)** takes a steep line up the bulging wall via some hard to see rusty bolts. In need of some love.

**The Amnicolist Spies on the Black Submarine (E5 6b)** start below and right of the large niche at half height. Climb the undercut flake line past a poor peg until it's possible to move leftwards into the niche. Continue leftwards to reach the belay of *The Ego has Landed*.

**Hard Torque (8a+)** &starf;&starf; Start below another line of undercuts leading up and slightly rightwards. Good bolts mark the line. Low in the grade.

**Living with a Porcupine (7a?)** At the top of the crag is a prominent jutting roof with a double ring bolt belay. Climb up past two PRs to a new bolt and the lower off.

**(7b)** A hard and fingery start leads to an easier finish.


**13. (7a+?)** The last route to start off a raised ledge at ground level. A hard start leads up to a shattered pillar just below the top.

**The Fall (8a)**  &starf;&starf;

**14. Vindicator (7c+)**  &starf; &starf; The most popular of the harder routes. A hard lock off from sloper leads to poweful undercut moves and sidepulls to an easier finish.

**Sky Fall (7c+)** The last route on the wall was recently retrobolted.
