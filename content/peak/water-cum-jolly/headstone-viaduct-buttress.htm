            <p>Technically not part of the Water Cum Jolly sector but it's close enough to be included here being situated about a mile downstream from Rubicon.</p>

            <p>This fine buttress has only 3 routes so far and was developed by Paul Freeman who climbed Blockbuster and the Blocky Road to Ruin, and Mark Pretty who climbed the extremely steep <em>The Blocky Horror Show</em> in 2013. The climbing is short, steep and physical on good holds and despite the names the rock is good quality. All the routes are worth doing.</p>


            <h3>Aspect</h3>

            <p>The crag faces SE and is rarely wet, even in the winter.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>The crag is a several hundred metres downstream of the spectacular viaduct at Monsal Head.</p>

            <p>Go down the hill from Monsal Head in the direction of Rubicon Wall (NW) and when the road flattens out park on the left. (-1.729252 53.243595)</p>

            <p>Walk back along the road take the public footpath past a house to cross the river via a footbridge. Follow the path uphill to join the Monsal trail, a track of a disused railway line. At the viaduct go through a gate on the R and follow the path down. After 300m or so the crag is visible on the hill on the right. A steep path leads up to the crag.</p>

            <h3>The Routes</h3>

            <p class="topo"><img src="/img/peak/water-cum-jolly/headstone-topo.jpg" alt="Headstone viaduct buttress topo"></p>

            <p>From left to right:</p>

            <p><strong>1. Blockbuster (6c+)</strong> takes the steep wall rightwards. A stick to clip the first bolt may be helpful.</p>
            <p><strong>2. The Blocky Horror Show (7b+)</strong> an unlikely looking line straight up the extremely steep, bulging wall.</p>
            <p><strong>3. The Blocky Road to Ruin (7a+)</strong> the steep L facing corner provides a brutal, gritstonesque tussel on jams, fingerlocks undercuts and jugs.</p>
