## Introduction

These walls have a handful of routes 4 to 7a+. The first has overhanging power problems and takes a while to dry whilst the second wall has open face climbs close to the river and dries more quickly.

## Approach

A little tricky. From Cressbrook Mill, go through the mill to the weir and cross the bridge before Rubicon Wall wall. After a few rock steps, turn right and follow the path above the cliffs overlooking the river on the right. After around 5 minutes go over a fence and down onto the railway track (the Monsal Trail). Follow this briefly and before the next tunnel hop over the fence and pick up a a path heading down into the trees. The first wall with five routes is soon evident. The second wall is just below and the third further down and around the corner at the water's edge.

**1. Spiralling Out (6b+)**  
A short undercut wall leads to a ledge. The upper wall is furnished with good holds and a span right to the belay

**2. The Power Grab (7a+) *★***  
A short wall and groove to a ledge. The upper wall has a very problematic finish on hidden holds.

**3. Yard Sale (7a+) *★***  
A straightforward start to a ledge and then a very bouldery bulge above.

**4. Helter Skelter (6c+) *★***  
A steep and fingery start to a ledge then a series of big pulls through the bulges onto a flake. Good climbing

The wall down and around to the right gives three short technical routes.
