            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>A couple of newly developed walls with a handful of routes. The first has overhanging power problems and takes a while to dry whilst the second wall has open face climbs close to the river and dries more quickly.</p>

            <h2>Access</h2>

            <p>A little tricky. From Cressbrook Mill, go through the mill to the weir and cross the bridge before Rubicon Wall wall. After a few rock steps, turn right and follow the path above the cliffs, over a fence after 5 minutes and down onto the railway track. Follow this and just before the next tunnel pass to its right and follow a path down, heading towards the Cornice. The first wall with five routes is immediately evident; The second wall is just below and the third further down and around the corner at the water's edge.</p>

            <p><b>2. Hombre (5+) </b>left side of wall with short tricky section</p>
            <p><b>3. Condom Nations (6b) * </b>centre of wall on good rock with a short tricky section </p>
            <p><b>4. Land Nodule (6a+) </b>right-hand of trio with a good and somewhat bling sequence</p>
            <p><b>5. King Kane (5) </b>the bulge and thin crack</p>
            <p><b>6. Friday Club (6a+) *</b>right-hand side of wall is very pleasant</p>

            <p><b>1. Spiralling Out (6b+) </b>a short undercut wall leads to a ledge. The upper wall is furnished with good holds and a span right to the belay</p>
            <p><b>2. The Power Grab (7a+) *</b> a short wall and groove to a ledge. The upper wall has a very problematic finish on hidden holds.</p>
            <p><b>3. Yard Sale (7a+) *</b> a straightforward start to a ledge and then a very bouldery bulge above. </p>
            <p><b>4. Helter Skelter (6c+) * </b>a steep and fingery start to a ledge then a series of big pulls through the bulges onto a flake. Good climbing</p>
            <p>The wall down and around to the right gives three short technical routes. </p>

            <p><b>4. Gnat Attack (7a) </b> intense little test piece just right to a shared belay </p>
            <p><b>5. One Greenbottle (7a+) * </b> very difficult but short section on the line to the right to a shared belay</p>
            <p><b>6. Bluebottle Life (6c) * </b>leftwards line with a tough start past the first bolt and slightly easier climbing above.</p>
