{.topo}

This is the left hand side of the crag.

**1. Tiddle-de-Dum (6c)**  
A short sharp shock through the overlaps.

**2. Te Deum E3 5b**  
Very bold climbing up the wall into a faint, left-trending crack.

**3. Hammy Hamster's Last Rites E2 5c *★***  
A bold little wall past a peg leads into the fine, left-hand crackline.

**4. Chiming Crack E3 6a *★***  
Moves out right with hard moves via a pod into a crack.

**5. Dangerous Liaisons (7c) *★***  
An old trad route that lost holds and been reclimbed and re-bolted. A knee pad is helpful but not essential. 
{.rebolted}

**6. Carillon Crack E3 5c *★***  
Up to the left-hand side of the alcove, exiting via a bulge and fine, and still tricky, crack.

**7. Silent Storm E5 6a**  
Move right across the alcove, runners out right, and back into the crack above it. Bold.

**8. Carol's Crack E3 5c *★***  
Climb into the alcove from the right and exit via a bulge and crackline directly above.

**9. Hemmingway's Horror E2 5c *★***  
Fine and amenable climbing moving rightwards via a scoop and exit crack.

**10. The Importance of Being Ernest E4 6a**  
After a short flake and step, a thin crack leads to a peg, step right and tricky finish.

**11. It Tolls for Thee (6c+) *★***  
A fine little route direct to a fingery finale.

**12. The Bellringer E2 5b *★***  
Excellent climbing moving right from the starting flake into a long thin crackline.

**13. Vapour Stream (7a+) *★***  
Recently straightened out with a good direct line. Bouldery.
