            <p>This is the right-hand side of the crag.</p>

            <p><b>46. Premature Evacuation/Fatal Hesitation (7b+) **</b> a steep and powerful start links into a direct connection into the belay of La Chute. Probably harder and not reclimbed since hold loss in 2021.</p>

            <p><b>47. Fatal Attraction (7a+) **</b> a good route, recleaned with a new start. Hard from the ledges. </p>

            <p><b>48. Sox E5 6a *</b> a direct line crossing La Cute. Re-equipped and cleaned to new belay.</p>

            <p><b>49. La Brute (7a) **</b> an eliminate with excellent climbing and a hard finish. Maybe easy 7a+?</p>

            <p><b>50. La Chute E5 6b **</b> the classic of the wall taking a leftwards line. Re-equipped, cleaned and new belay added.</p>

            <p><b>51. La Route (7a) **</b> now retro-bolted is a popular sport route. A steep start, up the crackline and into the hanging groove.</p>

            <p><b>52. Coldity Groove E3 5c *</b> good climbing via the next hanging groove gained by hard moves from below.</p>

            <p><b>53. Coldity Crack E1 5b</b> a pleasant route aiming for the upper crack. </p>

            <p><b>54. C'est Plastique (6b) *</b> a good eliminate with an excellent finale.</p>

            <p><b>55. Plastic Wonder VS 4c</b> the stepped crackline to a vegetated finale.</p>

            <p><b>56. Plastic Blinkers HVS 5b</b> the next crack right leads to a fine headwall. Watch out for the dead tree.</p>

            <p><b>57. Gwendoline HVS 5a *</b> the finale crackline gives a good little route.</p>

            <p><b>Dis-Orientated (6b+)</b> little wall behind tree to right. Hard at the finale.</p>

            <p><b>Unknown (??)</b> Further right is another short wall with bolts in.</p>
