            <p>This is the left hand side of the crag.</p>


            <p><b>1. Tiddle-de-Dum (6c)</b> a short sharp shock through the overlaps. </p>

            <p><b>2. Te Deum E3 5b</b> very bold climbing up the wall into a faint, left-trending crack.</p>

            <p><b>3. Hammy Hamster's Last Rites E2 5c &starf;</b> a bold little wall past a peg leads into the fine, left-hand crackline.</p>

            <p><b>4. Chiming Crack E3 6a &starf;</b> moves out right with hard moves via a pod into a crack.</p>

            <p><b>5. Dangerous Liaisons (7c) &starf;</b> old trad route that lost holds and been reclimbed and re-bolted. A knee pad is helpful but not essential. <span class="new">rebolted and reclimbed 2021</span>.</p>

            <p><b>6. Carillon Crack E3 5c &starf;</b> up to the left-hand side of the alcove, exiting via a bulge and fine, and still tricky, crack.</p>

            <p><b>7. Silent Storm E5 6a</b> moves right across the alcove, runners out right, and back into the crack above it. Bold.</p>

            <p><b>8. Carol's Crack E3 5c &starf;</b> into the alcove from the right and exit via a bulge and crackline directly above.</p>

            <p><b>9. Hemmingway's Horror E2 5c &starf;</b> fine and amenable climbing moving rightwards via a scoop and exit crack.</p>

            <p><b>10. The Importance of Being Ernest E4 6a</b> after s a short flake and step, a thin crack leads to a peg, step right and tricky finish.</p>

            <p><b>11. It Tolls for Thee (6c+) &starf;</b> a fine little route direct to a fingery finale.</p>

            <p><b>12. The Bellringer E2 5b &starf;</b> excellent climbing moving right from the starting flake into a long thin crackline.</p>

            <p><b>13. Vapour Stream (7a+) &starf;</b> recently straightened out with a good direct line. Bouldery.</p>
