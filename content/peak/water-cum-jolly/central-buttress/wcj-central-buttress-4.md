This is the right-hand side of the crag.

**46. Premature Evacuation/Fatal Hesitation (7b+) *★★***  
A steep and powerful start links into a direct connection into the belay of La Chute. Probably harder and not reclimbed since hold loss in 2021.

**47. Fatal Attraction (7a+) *★★***  
A good route, recleaned with a new start. Hard from the ledges.

**48. Sox E5 6a *★***  
A direct line crossing La Cute. Re-equipped and cleaned to new belay.

**49. La Brute (7a) *★★***  
An eliminate with excellent climbing and a hard finish. Maybe easy 7a+?

**50. La Chute E5 6b *★★***  
The classic of the wall taking a leftwards line. Re-equipped, cleaned and new belay added.

**51. La Route (7a) *★★***  
Now retro-bolted is a popular sport route. A steep start, up the crackline and into the hanging groove.

**52. Coldity Groove E3 5c *★***  
Good climbing via the next hanging groove gained by hard moves from below.

**53. Coldity Crack E1 5b**  
A pleasant route aiming for the upper crack.

**54. C'est Plastique (6b) *★***  
A good eliminate with an excellent finale.

**55. Plastic Wonder VS 4c**  
The stepped crackline to a vegetated finale.

**56. Plastic Blinkers HVS 5b**  
The next crack right leads to a fine headwall. Watch out for the dead tree.

**57. Gwendoline HVS 5a *★***  
The finale crackline gives a good little route.

**Dis-Orientated (6b+)**  
A little wall behind tree to right. Hard at the finale.

**Unknown (??)**  
Further right is another short wall with bolts in.
