            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>Tissington Spires is the furthest climbing from Milldale parking a 3km or 2 miles to walk. Follow the path past Reynard's Arch on the left. A little further on the impressive obelisk of Dovedale Church is passed on the other side of the river. Tissington Spires soon comes into view on the left. A path leads up through the undergrowth to the base of the crag. </p>

            <p><b>1. There Will Be Blood (8a)</b> a short wall at the far left-hand side of the crag, just off the topo.</p>
            <p><b>2. Resurrected (7c) ** </b>a steep wall lined with good pockets and breaks. Move right to the belay</p>
            <p><b>3. Debolted? Revolted! (6b+) </b> climbs the small wall of immaculate rock opposite Resurrected and much further up the gully. Finish on the large hold just left of the belay.</p>
