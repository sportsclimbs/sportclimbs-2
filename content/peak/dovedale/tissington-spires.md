## Approach

Tissington Spires is the furthest climbing from Milldale parking a 3km or 2 miles to walk. Follow the path past Reynard's Arch on the left. A little further on the impressive obelisk of Dovedale Church is passed on the other side of the river. Tissington Spires soon comes into view on the left. A path leads up through the undergrowth to the base of the crag.
