            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>Apart from classic aid routes bolts were unheard of in the area until the late 1980's. <em>Bolt It and Believe It!</em> at Dovedale Church was a mixed trad/bolt line but Andy Pollit's superb <em>Arch Enemies</em> and Simon Nadin's <em>666</em> were true sport climbs as were Mark Pretty's <em>No Pain No Gain</em> and <em>Manifold Exhaust</em> at Ladyside Crag. It was Pollit however, who stole the plum line with his audacious <em>Thormen's Moth</em> at Thor's Cave - a superb achievement.</p>

            <p>Little happened subsequently until Kristian Clemmow and Mark Pretty gave Beeston a revamp with several excellent pitches out of the <em>Ivy Gash</em> and the steep pocketed <em>Honorary Buoux</em>. Jon Clarke retroed old routes at Renyard's Arch plus adding a couple of good routes of his own whilst downstream at Tissington Spires Pretty added <em>There Will Be Blood</em> up the the thin wall between Brutus and Caesar. Jon Fulwood put in a few big shifts at Thor's Cave to produce some unusual but excellent routes there whilst Dan Varian chipped in with the hardest route at the crag <em>Móoguo</em>. Gary Gibson took a good look at Raven’s Tor and produced a collection of mid-grade routes at the right hand end, then did a similar job at Ladyside Crag. Recent developments have seen Dove Holes turned into an excellent sport climbing venue with Rob Mirfin's <em>The Oval</em> the hardest route so far whilst Pretty added <em>Resurrected</em> to Tissington Spires. Mirfin also climbed the bouldery and desperate <em>Singin in the Rain</em> at Ladyside Crag.</p>
