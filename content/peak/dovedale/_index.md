## History

Apart from classic aid routes bolts were unheard of in the area until the late 1980's. _Bolt It and Believe It!_ at Dovedale Church was a mixed trad/bolt line but Andy Pollit's superb _Arch Enemies_ and Simon Nadin's _666_ were true sport climbs as were Mark Pretty's _No Pain No Gain_ and _Manifold Exhaust_ at Ladyside Crag. It was Pollit however, who stole the plum line with his audacious _Thormen's Moth_ at Thor's Cave - a superb achievement.

Little happened subsequently until Kristian Clemmow and Mark Pretty gave Beeston a revamp with several excellent pitches out of the _Ivy Gash_ and the steep pocketed _Honorary Buoux_. Jon Clarke retroed old routes at Renyard's Arch plus adding a couple of good routes of his own whilst downstream at Tissington Spires Pretty added _There Will Be Blood_ up the the thin wall between Brutus and Caesar. Jon Fulwood put in a few big shifts at Thor's Cave to produce some unusual but excellent routes there whilst Dan Varian chipped in with the hardest route at the crag _Móoguo_. Gary Gibson took a good look at Raven’s Tor and produced a collection of mid-grade routes at the right hand end, then did a similar job at Ladyside Crag. 

Recent developments have seen Dove Holes turned into an excellent sport climbing venue with Rob Mirfin's _The Oval_ the hardest route so far whilst Pretty added _Resurrected_ to Tissington Spires. Mirfin also climbed the bouldery and desperate _Singin in the Rain_ at Ladyside Crag.
