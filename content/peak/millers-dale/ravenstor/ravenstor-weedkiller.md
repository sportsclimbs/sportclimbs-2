**1. Evolution (8c+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;

**2. Baby Chimes (8a)** &starf;&starf; The roof right of Evolution finishing at thin break is both powerful and baffling.

**3. The Green Alternative (7c+)** &starf; Start as for Baby Chimes then move right and fight your way to jugs and the belay.

**4. Weedkiller (7c+)** &starf; Right again a fierce roof lead to a layback move to gain jugs and the belay. Harder for the short.

**5. Rooster Booster pitch 1 (7c+)** &starf; Start up Sardine to the first break and follow this to the belay on Weedkiller.

**6. Allo Ethique (8a?)** &starf; Links Weedkiller into Sardine via Rooster Booster pitch 1. Rarely repeated and harder than it was originally.
