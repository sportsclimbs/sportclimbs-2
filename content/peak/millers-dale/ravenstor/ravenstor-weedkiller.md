**1. Evolution (8c+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Classic hard test 90's testpiece still sees relatively few repeats. Used as a start to *Devolution* (8c) *Stevolution* (9a) and *Mutation* (9a+)  
*F.A. Jerry Moffat 1995*

**2. Baby Chimes (8a) *&starf;&starf;***  
The roof right of Evolution finishing at thin break is both powerful and baffling.  
*F.A. Andy Pollit 1986. Reclimbed after rockfall by Ben Moon in 1990*

**3. The Green Alternative (7c+) *&starf;***  
Start as for Baby Chimes then move right and fight your way to jugs and the belay.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 2007*

**4. Weedkiller (7c+) *&starf;***  
Right again a fierce roof lead to a layback move to gain jugs and the belay. Harder for the short.  
*F.A. Tim Freeman 1984 at 7b. Reclimbed by Steve Lewis (1990) and others after rockfall*

**5. Rooster Booster pitch 1 (7c+) *&starf;***  
Start up Sardine to the first break and follow this to the belay on Weedkiller.  
*F.A. Jerry Moffatt 1982*

**6. Allo Ethique (8a?) *&starf;***  
Links Weedkiller into Sardine via Rooster Booster pitch 1. Rarely repeated and harder than it was originally.  
*F.A. JB Tribout 1985*
