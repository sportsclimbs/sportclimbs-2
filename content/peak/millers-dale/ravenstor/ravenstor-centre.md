![Raven Tor Central](/img/peak/millers-dale/ravenstor-central.jpg)

**1. Jehovahkill (8b+) &starf;&starf;**  
The attactive line of sidepulls and flakes is much harder than may first appear. Good climbing, rarely repeated.  
*F.A. John Welford 1993*

**2. Revelations (8b) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
Takes the obvious rounded arete feature. The crux pocket can seep and has diminished in size after excessive blowtorching.  
*F.A. Jerry Moffatt 1984* 

**3. Hubble (9a)** &starf;&starf;  
The most famous route at Raven Tor and the world's first 8c+ is now widely considered to be the world's first 9a.  
*F.A. Ben Moon 1990*

**4. Brandenburg Gate (9a+)** &starf;&starf;  
The old aid line was first conceived as a free route shortly after Hubble was climbed. It took over 3 decades for the final free ascent. Low in the grade. Finishes up Make It Funky.  
*F.A. Will Bosi 2021*

**5. Make It Funky (8c)** &starf;&starf;  
Now usually climbed by a slightly more direct start.

**6. Make It Funky original start (8c)** &starf;&starf;  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1993*

**7. Persian Dawn (8c+)** &starf;&starf;  
Adds a font 7C boulder problem direct finish to Make It Funky.  
*F.A. Buster Martin 2021*

**8. Mecca (8b with kneepad, 8b+ without)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
The UK's first 8b+ is typically climbed with kneepads nowadays making it somewhat less of a challenge. Takes the obvious groove.  
*F.A. Martin Atkinson 1988*

**9. Evolution (8c+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
Classic Moffatt testpiece and the first part of *Mutation (9a+)*.  
*F.A. Jerry Moffatt 1995*

**10. Baby Chimes (8a)**  &starf;&starf;  
The first part of Chimes of Freedom is now much harder than when it was first climbed. A hard and complicated boulder problem.  
*F.A. Andy Pollit 1986. Reclimbed by Ben Moon after rockfall in 1990*
