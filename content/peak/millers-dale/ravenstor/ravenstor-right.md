The RH end of the crag is much shorter and popular with boulderers. The main difficulties are often, but not always, in the steeper first few metres.

**1. The Wild West (8c+) *&starf;***  
The bulging wall to the right of *A Little Extra* followed by the thin wall above moving rightwards to join *Hooligan* gives this rarely repeated route.  
*F.A. Dawid Skoczylas 2016*

**2. Hooligan (8c) *&starf;***  
More desperate bouldering and thin face climbing to the right of *The Wild West*  
*F.A. Steve Dunning 2003*

**The Southern Hooligan (9a) *&starf;***  
A very hard boulder problem (8B+/8C) leads to an easier finish. See [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfnkQC9k2ZU).  
*F.A. Will Bosi 2022*

**3. Boot Boys (8a+) *&starf;&starf;***  
To the right of *Hooligan* is a promient jug at 3 metres. From this a hard move on a mono leads to better pockets. Fierce pulls off an undercut and crimps above lead leftwards to better holds and the belay.  
*F.A. Andy Pollit 1987*

**4. Out of My Boots (7c) *&starf;***  
As for *Boot Boys* to the first jug then pull right with difficulty to the big jug on *Out of My Tree*. Finish up this.  
*Steve McClure 1998*

**5. Out of My Tree (8a) *&starf;&starf;***  
A difficult pull on pockets leads to a good hold from where another hard move gains a jug and easier ground.  
*F.A. Andy Pollit 1987*

**6. Dialectics (8a+) *&starf;***  
Gain the first good hold on *Out of My Tree* then move right and up with difficulty.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1993*

**7. Pump Up the Power (8a+)**  
Just to the right gain a pocket easily then very difficult moves on poor edges leads to a good hold and a belay. Often highballed at font 7C+.  
*F.A. Ben Moon 1987*

**8. Rattle and Hump (8a) *&starf;***  
Three metres right of *Pump Up the Power* a tricky boulder problem leads to a jug. From here hard moves left lead to better holds and the top.  
*F.A. Malcolm Taylor 1989*

**9. Seraphim (8b+) *&starf;***  
Hard moves leftwards out of the start of *Wild in Me* lead to an easier though not easy, upper wall.  
*F.A. Rupert Davis 2007*

**10. Wild in Me (7c) *&starf;&starf;***  
A tricky boulder problem start is followed by a fierce pull to gain an obvious undercut. Thin moves above lead to easier ground.  
*F.A. Richard Davis 1986. Mark Pretty without chipped hold 1993*

**11. Super High Intensity Bodybuilding (7a) *&starf;***  
A hard pull on pockets lead to an undercut and then a good hold. From here further tricky moves lead to easier climbing and the belay.  
*F.A. Steve Lewis 1986*

**Saline Drip (E5 6b)**  
The smooth wall at the right end of the crag gives a hard fingery highball problem (7A).  
*F.A. Ron Fawcett 1981*
