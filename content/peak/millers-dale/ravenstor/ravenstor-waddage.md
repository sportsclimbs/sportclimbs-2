**1. Chimes of Resistance (8b) *&starf;&starf;***  
Follow *Chimes of Freedom* to it's belay but continue above the break for a couple of moves before moving right and making hard moves to a good undercut beneath the roof. Pull over this onto a hanging arête and up to a belay.  
*F.A. Ted Kingsnorth 2014*

**2. Right to Roam (8a) *&starf;&starf;***  
Climb *The Green Alternative* to its belay then follow an awkward hanging groove to a left exit that leads into *Chimes of Freedom*. Continue up this to just above the belay at the point where *Chimes of Resistance* moves right, instead climb direct to a break then traverse right to finish as for *Chimes of Resistance*. The finish of this route, if gained from *Chimes of Freedom* is **Freedom Fighter** (8a+).  
*F.A. Kristian Clemmow 2013*

**3. Waddage (8b) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Follow *Chimes of Freedom* till just before the step down left to the belay, instead climb direct to the break. The bulge above succumbs to a mighty leap to a jug from which easier climbing up and right lead to a belay on the ledge.  
*F.A. Steve McClure 2003*

**4. Killer Strumpet (8a) *&starf;&starf;***  
Follow *Right to Roam* to the faint break 6m above *Cream Team Special*. From here pull awkwardly leftwards into a groove (*Mecca* second pitch, E1). From here pull out left and up with diffiulty to join *Brazen Strumpet* at the overlap. Continue up this to the top.
