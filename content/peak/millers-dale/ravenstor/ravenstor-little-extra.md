**1. The Call of Nature (8a) *&starf;&starf;***  
Climb a vague short groove then move up and right with difficulty to gain sidepulls. A couple of hard moves lead to easier climbing on the slabbier upper wall. A popular route.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 2009*

**2. Verbal Abuse (7c+) *&starf;&starf;***  
The shallow groove and flake right of *Call of Nature* lead to a bouldery section to gain an overlap. Pull over this rightwards and continue more easily.  
*F.A Jerry Moffatt 1984*

**3. Hot Flushes (8a) *&starf;***  
As for Verbal Abuse to the top of the flake then make difficult moves right to join *The Flushings*. Finish up this.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1994*

**4. Ring of Fire (7c+) *&starf;***  
As for *Verbal Abuse* but almost immediately traverse right on undercuts before awkward layback moves lead to a junction with *The Flushings*. Finish up this.  
*F.A. Kristian 2011*

**5. The Flushings (7b+) *&starf;***  
As for *A Little Extra* to a shallow groove. Swing out left and scrabble frantically up the wall above.  
*F.A. Malcolm Taylor 1989*

**6. A Little Extra (7b) *&starf;***  
To the right of *Verbal Abuse* start is a prominent jug at 3m. Start on a boulder and make a jump for the jug. Continue with difficulty to a large undercut flake. Traverse right and up to easier ground.  
*F.A. Tom Proctor 1979*

**7. Little Boots (7b+) *&starf;***  
Start up *Little Extra* to the large jug then move R and up the thin wall to join *Boot Boys* at the belay.  
*F.A. Kristian Clemmow 2013?*

**Cream Tea Special (7b+) *&starf;***  
Start as for *Little Boots* but continue traversing with difficulty to join *Out of My Tree*. Finish up this.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1995*

**8. The Wild West (8c+) *&starf;***  
The bulging wall to the right of *A Little Extra* followed by the thin wall above moving rightwards to join *Hooligan* gives this rarely repeated route.  
*F.A. Dawid Skoczylas 2016*
