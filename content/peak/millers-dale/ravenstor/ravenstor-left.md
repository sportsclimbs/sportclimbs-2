**1. Sheikh, Rattle and Roll (7a+)**  
After a wet start follow resin bolts staying close to the ivy on the upper wall.

**2. Koran Super Direct (7a)**  
A difficult lower wall leads to a tree. From here awkward climbing leads to a break and hard clip. Move left and up on good rock to the belay.

**3. Austin Powers (7a+)**  
Right of *KSD* is a wet left leaning crack. This is the start to the debolted Ayatollah (7a). Right again is a cleaner wall. Climb the wall with difficulty to a break then move left to gain a flake system. Follow this to a break then make tricky moves over a bulge to reach the belay. (**Barely Decent**, 7b+, climbs the wall left of Full Monty before moving left to join *Austin Powers*.)

**4. The Full Monty (7c+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Right of *Austin Powers* the ledge ends at an old tree stump. Scratch your way up the faint groove behind the stump (various methods possible) to reach good holds in a break. Sustained climbing up, right then back left leads to a large break. The awkward bulging wall above leads to a large flake. Move right then ever steeper climbing above (belay of **Indceent Exposure**, 7c &starf;&starf;&starf;) leads through a bulge to the belay. (**Balls Out** 7c, avoids the move right then left above the first break by a hard pull whilst **Prowess**, 8a &starf;&starf; follows Full Monty to the large flake then steps right and climbs *In and Out of Body Experience* to the roof before attacking it directly with difficulty. **Half Decent**, 7c, follows *An In and Out of Body Experience* to just before the rock over but then climbs direct into Full Monty finishing at the Indecent belay.)

**5. Indecent Hubris (7b+) *&starf;***  
Start as for *Full Monty* to the first break. Pull up to the overlap and make the first hard move of *Balls Out* before traversing left to gain a large hollow block. Awkward climbing above leads to a break. Continue direct through a slight bulge to the belay.

**6. An In and Out of Body Experience (8a) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Start as for the *Full Monty* but almost immediately move right and up past an overlap to the break. Pull up and right to a side pull then make the famous rock over move to gain better holds. Steep moves lead to jugs in the break and a welcome rest. Step left and pull through the bulge with difficulty to before moving right to some undercuts. From here steep pulls lead to a small ledge (belay of **Body Machine** 7c+). Step left and attack the leaning wall above up to a roof, pull left with difficulty over the LH end of the roof to join the last few moves of the Full Monty. (**Body Builder**, 8a+ follows the original route to the rest at the break before moving right and pulling through the bulging wall above with difficulty to join the parent route at the undercuts.) 

**7. The Prow (8a) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
As for an *In and Out of Body Experience* to the overlap then traverse right to jugs. Awkward moves up to and past an obvious flake lead to a hole in the break, move right then attack the bulging wall above via a layback flake followed by a hard pull to gain a hanging groove, bridging rest here. The overhanging groove above is followed to the roof where difficult moves lead to good holds and a belay on the R. Care with rope drag required.

**8. The Crucifiction 8a *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Follow *The Prow* to the hanging groove rest then step right over an overlap and climb the pumpy wall above before hard moves left gain better holds and the belay. (**Ibuprofix** 7c+ &starf;&starf;&starf; climbs *The Full Monty* to the large break then steps right into *Body Machine* and follows this to it's belay. Climb the groove above as for *The Prow* before moving right at the roof to join *The Crucifiction*, finish up this.)

**9.  Proud Whore (7c+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Follow *The Prow* to the top of the layback flake, then make hard moves up and right to gain a hanging groove. Follow this to a belay on a ledge at the top of the crag. (*The Whore of Babylon*, 8a, gained the first break of *The Prow* direct via a technical wall and an aided start of what is now *Hubble*. Rarely repeated.)

**10. Brazen Strumpet (8a) *&starf;&starf;***  
Follow *The Prow* to the end of the first traverse then pull up and right up the thin wall to gain the large break. Step right then make hard moves up and slightly left to join Proud Whore at a good hold, swing right and over the small overhang to finish on a ledge at the top of the crag.

**11. Rage 8b *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Climb *Revelations* but continue up *The Prow* to the hole in the break. A thin seam is followed with difficulty to a break, hard moves up and left lead to the belay of Body Machine. (**Anger Management**, 8a+, climbs *Body Machine* until just after the rock over move then moves right into The Prow to join Rage at the thin seam. **Cross'n'Angry**, 8a+ climbs *Anger Management* but continues up *Crucifiction* whilst **Rage Into Crucifiction**, 8b, is self explanatory.)

**12. Mecca Extension (8b+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
From the *Mecca* belay climb the black wall to undercuts. Move right with difficulty to a right facing flake. Up this, hard, to better holds and the belay. Originally climbed without kneepads at 8c.

**13. The Hajj (8c) *&starf;&starf;***  
The lefthand finish to *Mecca* is essentially a hard boulder problem (font 7C).

**14. Kaabah (8c) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
At the top of the groove of *Mecca* continue direct to a good hold. There are two methods to gain the flake of *Mecca Extension*, either direct (the original unrepeated method, 8c+) or by stepping left into *Mecca Extension* and finishing as for that route (8c).
