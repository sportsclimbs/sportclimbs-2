__1. Sheikh, Rattle and Roll (7a+)__ wet start following resin bolts and close to the ivy on the upper wall

__2. Koran Super Direct (7a)__ difficult lower wall leads to a tree. Awkward climbing to a break, hard clip, before moving left and up good rock to the belay.

**3. Austin Powers (7a+)** right of *KSD* is a wet left leaning crack, this is the start to the debolted Ayatollah (7a). R again is a cleaner wall. Climb the wall with difficulty to a break then move left to gain a flake system. Follow this to a break then make awkward moves over a bulge to reach the belay. (**Barely Decent**, 7b+, climbs the wall L of Full Monty before moving L to join *Austin Powers*.)

__4. The Full Monty (7c+) &starf;&starf;&starf;__ R of *Austin Powers* the ledge ends at an old tree stump. Scratch your way up the faint groove behind the stump (various methods possible) to reach good holds in a break. Sustained climbing up, right then back left leads to a large break. The awkward bulging wall above leads to a large flake. Move R then ever steeper climbing above (belay of **Indceent Exposure**, 7c &starf;&starf;&starf;) leads through a bulge to the belay. (**Balls Out** 7c, avoids the move R then L above the first break by a hard pull whilst **Prowess**, 8a &starf;&starf; follows Full Monty to the large flake then steps R and climbs *In and Out of Body Experience* to the roof before attacking it directly with difficulty. **Half Decent**, 7c, follows *An In and Out of Body Experience* to just before the rock over but then climbs direct into Full Monty finishing at the Indecent belay.)

__5. Indecent Hubris (7b+)__ &starf; Start as for *Full Monty* to the first break. Pull up to the overlap and make the first hard move of *Balls Out* before traversing L to gain a large hollow block. Awkward climbing above leads to a break. Continue direct through a slight bulge to the belay.

__6. An In and Out of Body Experience (8a)__ &starf;&starf;&starf; Start as for the *Full Monty* but almost immediately move R and up past an overlap to the break. Pull up and R to a side pull then make the famous rock over move to gain better holds. Steep moves lead to jugs in the break and a welcome rest. Step L and pull through the bulge with difficulty to before moving R to some undercuts. From here steep pulls lead to a small ledge (belay of **Body Machine** 7c+). Step L and attack the leaning wall above up to a roof, pull L with difficulty over the LH end of the roof to join the last few moves of the Full Monty. (**Body Builder**, 8a+ follows the original route to the rest at the break before moving R and pulling through the bulging wall above with difficulty to join the parent route at the undercuts.) 

__7. The Prow 8a &starf;&starf;&starf;__ As for an *In and Out of Body Experience* to the overlap then traverse R to jugs. Awkward moves up to and past an obvious flake lead to a hole in the break, move R then attack the bulging wall above via a layback flake followed by a hard pull to gain a hanging groove, bridging rest here. The overhanging groove above is followed to the roof where difficult moves lead to good holds and a belay on the R. Care with rope drag required.

__8. The Crucifiction 8a &starf;&starf;&starf;__ Follow *The Prow* to the hanging groove rest then step R over an overlap and climb the pumpy wall above before hard moves L gain better holds and the belay. (**Ibuprofix** 7c+ &starf;&starf;&starf; climbs *The Full Monty* to the large break then steps R into *Body Machine* and follows this to it's belay. Climb the groove above as for *The Prow* before moving R at the roof to join *The Crucifiction*, finish up this.)

__9.  Proud Whore (7c+) &starf;&starf;&starf;__ Follow *The Prow* to the top of the layback flake, then make hard moves up and R to gain a hanging groove. Follow this to a belay on a ledge at the top of the crag. (*The Whore of Babylon*, 8a, gained the first break of *The Prow* direct via a technical wall and an aided start of what is now *Hubble*. Rarely repeated.)

__10. Brazen Strumpet (8a) &starf;&starf;__ Follow *The Prow* to the end of the first traverse then pull up and R up the thin wall to gain the large break. Step R then make hard moves up and slightly L to join Proud Whore at a good hold, swing R and over the small overhang to finish on a ledge at the top of the crag.

__11. Rage 8b &starf;&starf;&starf;__ Climb *Revelations* but continue up *The Prow* to the hole in the break. A thin seam is followed with difficulty to a break, hard moves up and L lead to the belay of Body Machine. (**Anger Management**, 8a+, climbs *Body Machine* until just after the rock over move then moves R into The Prow to join Rage at the thin seam. **Cross'n'Angry**, 8a+ climbs *Anger Management* but continues up *Crucifiction* whilst **Rage Into Crucifiction**, 8b, is self explanatory.)

__12. Mecca Extension (8b+)__ &starf;&starf;&starf; From the *Mecca* belay climb the black wall to undercuts. Move right with difficulty to a right facing flake. Up this, hard, to better holds and the belay. Originally climbed without kneepads at 8c.

__13. The Hajj (8c)__ &starf;&starf; The lefthand finish to *Mecca* is essentially a hard boulder problem (font 7C)

__14. Kaabah (8c)__ &starf;&starf;&starf; At the top of the groove of *Mecca* continue direct to a good hold. There are two methods to gain the flake of *Mecca Extension*, either direct (the original unrepeated method, 8c+) or by stepping left into *Mecca Extension* and finishing as for that route (8c)
