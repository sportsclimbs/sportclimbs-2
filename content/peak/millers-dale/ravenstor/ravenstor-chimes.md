**1. Evolution (8c+)** &starf;&starf;&starf; The small roof a few metres right of Mecca is hard (font 8A) but the redpoint crux is found in the last few metres of this finger ripping classic.

**2. Mutation (9a?)** &starf;&starf;&starf; Where *Evolution* this desparate direct finish (font 8A) leads to the sanctuary of good holds at the top of *Chimes of Freedom*. Unrepeated and may well be 9a+.

**3. Devolution (8b+)** &starf;&starf;&starf; From the thin break above the initial bulge of *Evolution* pull up and right into Chimes and finish up this.

**4. Chimes of Freedom (8a+)** &starf;&starf;&starf; The roof right of *Evolution* is climbed by any one of a variety of methods to a thin break (*Baby Chimes* 8a finishes here). A couple of tricky moves lead to jugs and a good shakeout. From here some hard moves lead to an escape right into undercut flakes. Follow these left to jugs and a belay. (The original finish avoided the escape right by moving left and climbing direct to the belay. Now much harder, 8b).
