**1. Evolution (8c+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
The small roof a few metres right of *Mecca* is hard (font 8A) but the redpoint crux is found in the last few metres of this finger ripping classic.  
*F.A. Jerry Moffatt 1995*

**2. Mutation (9a+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Where *Evolution* goes left this desperate direct finish (font 8A) leads to the sanctuary of good holds at the top of *Chimes of Freedom*. It was unrepeated for 23 years!  
*F.A. Steve McClure 1998*

**3. Devolution (8b+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
From the thin break above the initial bulge of *Evolution* pull up and right into *Chimes* and finish up this.  
*F.A. Rupert Davis 2005*

**4. Chimes of Freedom (8a+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
The roof right of *Evolution* is climbed by any one of a variety of methods to a thin break (*Baby Chimes* 8a finishes here). A couple of tricky moves lead to jugs and a good shakeout. From here some hard moves lead to an escape right into undercut flakes. Follow these left to jugs and a belay. (The original finish avoided the escape right by moving left and climbing direct to the belay. Now much harder, 8b).  
*F.A. Andy Pollit 1986. Reclimbed after rockfall by Ben Moon in 1990*
