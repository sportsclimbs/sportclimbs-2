## About

Geographically Miller's Dale is part of the same valley as Cheedale and Water Cum Jolly, (the Wye valley) and in fact it connects these two areas. A small road runs along the bottom making most of the climbing very accessible. You can park at the foot of Ravens Tor (if there's room). Crags on the South side of the river a little less accessible but still within easy reach.
