### Character

This is the buttress on the opposite side of the river to Ravens Tor, Miller's Dale and slightly upstream. It has a clutch vertical wall climbs on the right side and steeper, harder routes on its left. This lefthand section can remain climable in light rain.


The buttress faces North so can provide a good usually quiet spot on a hot summer's day.


The far left-hand side of the buttress (not described here) has a handful of trad routes but has become overgrown and has not been recleaned.



### Approach

Park as for Ravens Tor and walk down the road to the first bridge across the river. Climb up the steps in front of you, with Ergonomic Buttress to your right and reach the Monsal trail, the path of an old railway track. Walk right (west) along this past a railed off area on the right and through a cutting. As soon as the quarried cutting ends a vague track can be seen on the right leading into the trees. You can also reach this point by parking at the Millers Dale carpark and following the Monsal trail east over the viaduct. Follow this, down a knotted rope and traverse down and to the right (facing out) to the cliff. Please do not traverse the river bank. Please leave the same way as you came in.
