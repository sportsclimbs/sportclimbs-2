{.topo}

**Turf â€˜em Off (6b+)** Easy lower wall right of Rippemoff to excellent steep wall that's looks harder than the grade suggests.

**10. Glue 'em Back (7b)**  leftwards line via intricate wall from left end of terrace.

**There May be Rubble Ahead (7b+)** unbalanced climbing with a desperate crux.

**11. Dig for Victory (7c)**  the left most line from the ledge. The left-hand variant is **Dig Deeper (8a).**

**12. Ozone Bozo (7c)**  &starf;  a tough problem from the left end of the ledge via a sling on a bolt. The dubious looking finishing flake is best avoided by climbing up the wall to the left.

**13. Tollbar (8a+)** &starf;&starf; fingery right-hand version of Ozone.

**Double the Rubble (7c)** the gently overhanging wall to the right.

**14 Trouble with Rubble (8a)** &starf;  short intense sequence taking an obvious line.

**15. Big Apple (8a)**  &starf;  the faint blunt rib gives a fingery exercise.

**16. Little Plum (8a, 7b+)**  &starf;&starf;  the old classic with a desperate, boulder-problem lower wall and fine roof finale.

**17. Lover's Leap (7b+)** &starf; climbs the LH side of the Little Plum roof.

**18. Ming the Merciless (8a+)**  &starf;  the first bolted line right of Little Plum

**19. Virgin King (7b+)**  &starf;  finishes to the left of the the line that is marked.

**20. Smoothlands (6a)**  short lower wall warm up

**21. Lowerlands (5)**  right-hand warm up.

<!-- **23. King of Ming (7b+)**  &starf;&starf;  perhaps the best route here with a tough central section and excellent final through the bulges on the headwall. -->

**22. Lowlands (6c+)** &starf; technical blunt rib, feels tricky for the grade and now has a new finish via a shallow groove, bulge and headwall.

**23. Dreamcatcher (6b+)**  &starf;&starf;  a long route packed with interest: a technical lower wall and engrossing final bulge.

**24. Creamsnatcher (6b)**  &starf;  the right-hand line gives pleasant sustained interest.

**Gulp and Go (6b+)**  &starf; start R of Creamsnatcher, joining that route in the centre before breaking out R and continuing up with a short difficult sequence above the Pendulum break. **70m rope required**

The next routes start further right...

**25. Can't Stop Now (6c)**  &starf; short hard section branching off left from 4000. Finishes at a belay below the main break. There are two extentions:

**Redeployed (6c+)**  &starf; the left-hand extension above the belay past a prominent undercut with hard moves to reach it.

**Up Yours (7a)** the RH extension above the belay of *Can't Stop Now*.

**26. Four Thousand (6c)**  &starf; starts up the left most line then takes the second line of bolts breaking out right. Finishes up a groove above the main break. Lowering off at the belay before the break is **2000 (6a+)**.

**27. Onwards and Upwards (6a)** &starf; start up 4000 but take the first line of bolts straight up and right. BB below the first break.

**28. Nowt about Change (6b)** &starf; to the R a parallel line to the previous route with a tricky finale on layaways.

**Just End It! (6a+)**  &starf; start through overlap then direct via shallow groove up to a BB between the two main breaks.

**End, Stop, Finale (6b)** the next line going rightwards through overlap and ledges to blunt rib.

**The Last Stop (5)** start up the previous route but then take the RH line of bolts to a steep finale.
