            <h2>Approach</h2>

            <p>From Garage Buttress walk up the track. After 100m or so a prominent corner can be seen starting off a small grassy platform. This is the first pitch of Memnon (E2 5c). These 4 routes climb the left and right walls of the corner. Although short, the rock is of excellent quality.</p>

            <p><b>1. Immortal Combat (6b+)</b> the first sport route on the left wall starting from at ground level. Hard moves and not obvious routefinding.</p>
            <p><b>2. I Can't Breathe (6c+) </b> starts from the grassy ledge L of the corner.</p>
            <p><b>3. Black Power (6c) </b> an old, possibly unrepeated E5 trad route, now a good sport pitch. Direct up the wall R of the corner. Good fingery climbing.</p>
            <p><b>4. Take A Knee (6c)</b> the right line on the right wall. Avoid the arete apart from the short section by the 2nd bolt. At the last bolt go L almost into Black Power before coming back R to finish on a good jug above the belay.</p>
