## Lower section

**1. Turf 'em Off (6b+)** Easy lower wall right of Rippemoff to excellent steep wall.

**2. Glue 'em Back (7b)**  leftwards line via intricate wall from left end of terrace.

**3. There May be Rubble Ahead (7b+)** unbalanced climbing with a desperate crux.

**4. Rubble Rouser 7c+** a hybrid route that breaks out right from the *There May Be Rubble*&hellip; to finish up *Dig Deeper*.

**5. Dig Deeper (8a)** &starf; leaves *Dig for Victory* at it's third bolt via a pocket to gain and sumount the difficult bulge above.

**6. Dig for Victory (7c)**  the left most line from the ledge. The left-hand variant is **Dig Deeper (8a).**

**7. Ozone Bozo (7c)**  &starf;  a tough problem from the left end of the ledge via a sling on a bolt. Originally finished up the tottering flake but much safer finishing up *Dig for Victory*.

**8. Tollbar (8a+)** &starf;&starf; fingery right-hand version of Ozone.

**9. Double the Rubble (7c)** &starf; the gently overhanging wall to the right.

**10. Trouble with Rubble (8a)** &starf;  short intense sequence on obvious line.

**11. Big Apple (8a)**  &starf;  the faint blunt rib gives a fingery exercise.

**12. Little Plum (8a, 7b+)**  &starf;&starf;  the old classic with a desperate, boulder-problem lower wall and fine roof finale.

**13. Ming the Merciless (8a+)**  &starf;  the first bolted line right of Little Plum

**14. Smoothlands (6a)**  short lower wall warm up

**15. Virgin King (7b)** &starf; A logical link up of some older routes takes the best climbing up this part of the wall. Start up *Lowerlands* or *Smoothlands* and continue up the steepening wall moving L then up to ledges. Continue up through bulges above. 30m.

**28. My Middle Name is Rubble (7c)** The righthand extension straight through the bulges.

**29. Golden Delicious (8a)** The extension to *Trouble with Rubble*.

**30. If You're Looking for Rubble (8a)** Follow *Golden Delicious* to the break then traverse right a short way then climb straight up through the bulge.

**31. Crankerdown (8a)** Start from the top of *Big Apple*.

**32. The Big Leap Forward (8a)** From the top of *Big Apple* climb up and move right under the bulge. Climb up to the break and through the bulges above.
