**28. My Middle Name is Rubble (7c)** The righthand extension straight through the bulges.

**29. Golden Delicious (8a)** The extension to *Trouble with Rubble*.

**30. If You're Looking for Rubble (8a)** Follow *Golden Delicious* to the break then traverse right a short way then climb straight up through the bulge.

**31. Crankerdown (8a)** Start from the top of *Big Apple*.

**32. The Big Leap Forward (8a)** From the top of *Big Apple* climb up and move right under the bulge. Climb up to the break and through the bulges above.
