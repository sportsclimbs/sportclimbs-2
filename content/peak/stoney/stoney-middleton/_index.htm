            <!-- <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Stoney Middleton is the nearest limestone climbing to Sheffield and Garage Buttress is its most accessible cliff. Yet despite this fact development here has been surprisingly slow. First climbed on in the 60s with routes like Pendulum (HVS 5a), girdle crossing the obvious horizontal break at half height.

Even climbing legend Tom Proctor, after establishing many hard classics elsewhere at Stoney, was late to make his mark here. In 1980 he climbed his hardest Stoney new route of all, Four Minute Tiler (E5 6b). This was eclipsed the following year when Jerry Moffatt succeeded in freeing the first pitch of Little Plum, graded E6 6c (7c+), one of the very hardest routes in the country at the time. A year later, in 1982, he added the top pitch as well.

For the next 20 years the pace of new routes continued at a slug-like pace.

Then 2002 Mark Pretty added  <em>The Lover&rsquo;s Leap</em> (7b+) an obscure alternative top pitch to Little Plum, but important because it was perhaps the crags first true sport route and a sign of things to come. Development continued slowly 

In 2013 Gary Gibson added 4000, a name which put a figure on the number of new routes he had done.

            <h3>Character</h3>

            <p>The crag traditionally named Stoney Middleton is the cliffs on the right side of the road immediately after the village when travelling west. Most of the climbing here is trad but there is a plethora of good and popular sport climbs on Garage Buttress. A handful more were added more recently a little further up below Windy Ledge.</p>

            <p>Featuring fingery face climbing with bulging walls and overhangs above the main horizontal break these routes, unlike almost everywhere else at Stoney, don't yet have that glass like finish to them. On Garage Buttress sport routes now outnumber trad with over 30 climbs here covering almost every grade from 5+ to 8a+.</p>

            <h3>Aspect</h3>

            <p>The crag faces south and gets the most of the sun on a sunny day although belaying at the bottom is cooler from the shade of the trees. It's an open and airy crag that dries quickly after rain.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>When heading westwards on the A623 pass through the village of Stoney Middleton, past the Little India cafe on the right. Just past this on the left side of the road is a good parking area. Walk up the Dale and Garage Buttress is the first accessible cliff, about 150m on the right.</p>
