            <p>Just to the L of the Chunky Buttress routes is a smoother wall with a series of short, athletic and bouldery routes. The wall gets some sun in the morning though tree cover provide some shade. It rarely gets wet making it a popular spot for damp days too.</p>

            <p><b>1. There will be Mud (6c+)</b> The furthest left line on the wall. Start by scrambling up to the big tree. 4BRs</p>
            <p><b>2. My Empire of Dirt (7a)</b> finds a way up the wall via an intricate series of bouldery moves. 6BRs</p>
            <p><b>3. Rhubarb (6c) *</b> Another toughie. Branches L out of the right-hand line via a hueco. Powerful moves on good holds and perhaps the best on the wall. 5BRs</p>
            <p><b>4. Custard (6b+) *</b>the right-hand line has a tricky crux for all but the very tall. 5BRs</p>
            <p><b>5. There Will Be Crud (6b+)</b> one tough move then it eases. Challenging. 4BRs</p>
            <p><b>6. Latin Lingo (6a+)</b> a steep route starting up the obvious crack.</p>

            <p>The three routes R of here are part of Chunky Buttress and are from L to R: <b>Tower of Treats (6b)</b>, <b>Vlad (6a+)</b> and <b>Chunky (6b)</b></p>
