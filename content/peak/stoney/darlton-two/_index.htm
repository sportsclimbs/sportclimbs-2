<h2>aka Hidden Quarry</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><img src="/img/peak/stoney/darlton-6b.jpg">Also known as <em>Hidden Quarry</em> this is another new quarry with relatively easy access and lots of new routes. There are some still some projects marked so please respect these.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>Drive up from Stoney Middleton past Stoney West and just after the sharp right hand bend&mdash;before Horseshoe Quarry (and just after Horse Thief Quarry)&mdash;make a sharp left turn back on yourself. Drive up here for 200m and there is parking available on the left - please park carefully to allow as many cars to park here as possible.</p>

<p>Walk up the road a little and look for a vague path on the left through the bushes and over a small fence - the same as for Sit Down Buttress. This leads through a meadow and into the quarry. Bear right into the trees and Chunky Buttress can soon be seen on the right. Continue along the path to gain the ledge that leads to Main Wall.</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>

<p>There are two tiers. Chunky Buttress is on the right immediately on entering the quarry and the lines will become obvious from the bolts and the photos.</p>
