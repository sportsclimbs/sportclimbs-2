Just to the L of the Chunky Buttress routes is a smoother wall with a series of short, athletic and bouldery routes. The wall gets some sun in the morning though tree cover provide some shade. It rarely gets wet making it a popular spot for damp days too.

{.topo}

**1. There will be Mud (6c+)**  
The furthest left line on the wall. Start by scrambling up to the big tree. 4BRs

**2. My Empire of Dirt (7a)**  
finds a way up the wall via an intricate series of bouldery moves. 6BRs

**3. Rhubarb (6c) ★**  
Another toughie. Branches L out of the right-hand line via a hueco. Powerful moves on good holds and perhaps the best on the wall. 5BRs

**4. Custard (6b+) ★**the right-hand line has a tricky crux for all but the very tall. 5BRs

**5. There Will Be Crud (6b+)**  
one tough move then it eases. Challenging. 4BRs

**6. Latin Lingo (6a+)**  
a steep route starting up the obvious crack.

The three routes R of here are part of Chunky Buttress and are from L to R:  
**Tower of Treats (6b)**  
**Vlad (6a+)**  
**Chunky (6b)**
