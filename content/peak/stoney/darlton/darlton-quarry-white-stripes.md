This is the wall on the right as you enter the quarry. It is still a little dusty and requires some traffic but should clean up in time.

The leftmost route is alongisde an impressive 'plank' bolted to the cliff: **Still Game (5+)** ★. Further to the right is a long slim groove: **Darlton Slab VS 4c** takes the pleasant slabby face left of this and **Bucket List (5+)** takes the faint leftwards trending line around to the right.
