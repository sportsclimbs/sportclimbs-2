![Shady wall Darlton Quarry](/img/peak/stoney/Darlton.jpg)
{.topo}


**1. Project**

**2. This is not a Drill (7a) *&starf;***  
fine face climb with a central crux on small incut holds

**3. Shady Business (6c+) *&starf;***  
tough face climbing above a ledge

**4. I am a Darlek (6c)**  
a touch fingery start leads to sustained face.

**5. The Beast of Darlton (7b)**  
a tough route with a difficult lower half and a very frustrating sequence through the overlaps.

**6. The Who? (7a)**  
another touch lower wall with sustained moves to a hard finishing move onto a ledge.

**7. Tean Dream (7a+)**  
good sustained face to a mean overlap.

**8. Blue View (6c+)**  
the vague blunt arÃªte has a suprisingly tough sequence of moves.

**9. The Knew (6c+) *&starf;***  
the thin crackline with good moves and a hard finishing move to the belay.

**10. The Grey (7a) *&starf;***  
the excellent blank-looking face to the right. High steps, crossovers and rockovers. Harder climbed direct.

The easier routes lie on the walls on the right-hand side of the quarry. The leftmost route is alongisde an impressive 'plank' bolted to the cliff: **Still Game (5+)*&starf;***. further to the right is a long slim groove: **Darlton Slab VS 4c** takes the pleasant slabby face left of this and **Bucket List (5+)** takes the faint leftwards trending line around to the right.
