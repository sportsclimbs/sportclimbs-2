## Introduction


This crag was made famous in 2021 when Tom Cruise visited to use it for a train crash stunt in the film Mission Impossible 7. The quarry on the opposite side of the road to Stoney West. The main wall gives a number of tough wall climbs on generally good rock in a typical quarry setting. There are also a number of easy sport climbs on the opposite, south facing White Stripes Wall.


## Approach

From the parking place for Stoney West, walk up back toward Stoney Middletona short way to an entrance to a small road on the right. Go past a barrier into a small 'loading bay'. Pass the fence and hop over the next fence - this point can also be gained from the public footpath directly below (limited parking) - and into the quarry. The main wall will be seen in the top left-hand corner of the quarry.

No access has been granted so if asked to leave please do so courteously.

**1. Project**

**2. This is not a Drill (7a)** &starf; fine face climb with a central crux on small incut holds

**3. Shady Business (6c+)** &starf; tough face climbing above a ledge

**4. I am a Darlek (6c)** a touch fingery start leads to sustained face.

**5. The Beast of Darlton (7b)** a tough route with a difficult lower half and a very frustrating sequence through the overlaps.

**6. The Who? (7a)** another touch lower wall with sustained moves to a hard finishing move onto a ledge.

**7. Tean Dream (7a+)** good sustained face to a mean overlap.

**8. Blue View (6c+)** the vague blunt arete has a suprisingly tough sequence of moves.

**9. The Knew (6c+)** &starf; the thin crackline with good moves and a hard finishing move to the belay.

**10. The Grey (7a)** &starf; the excellent blank-looking face to the right. High steps, crossovers and rockovers. Harder climbed direct.

The easier routes lie on the walls on the right-hand side of the quarry. The leftmost route is alongisde an impressive 'plank' bolted to the cliff: **Still Game (5+)** &starf;. further to the right is a long slim groove: **Darlton Slab VS 4c** takes the pleasant slabby face left of this and **Bucket List (5+)** takes the faint leftwards trending line around to the right.
