            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <P>A new crag has been developed in the quarry opposite to Stoney West. It gives a number of tough wall climbs on generally good rock in a typical quarry setting. There are also a couple of easy sport climbs with lots of rock left for more, should you be willing to be prepared for a lot of hard work.</P>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <P>From the parking place for Stoney West, walk up the small road past a barrier into a small 'loading bay'. Pass the fence and hop over the next fence - this point can also be gained from the public footpath directly below (limited parking) - and into the quarry. The main wall will be seen in the top left-hand corner of the quarry.</P>
            <P>No access has been granted so if asked to leave please do so courteously.</P>

            <P><b>1. Project</b></P>
            <P><b>2. This is not a Drill (7a)</b> &starf; fine face climb with a central crux on small incut holds</P>
            <P><b>3. Shady Business (6c+)</b> &starf; tough face climbing above a ledge</P>
            <P><b>4. I am a Darlek (6c+) </b> a touch fingery start leads to sustained face.</P>
            <P><b>5. The Beast of Darlton (7b) </b>a tough route with a difficult lower half and a very frustrating sequence through the overlaps.</P>
            <P><b>6. The Who? (7a) </b>another touch lower wall with sustained moves to a hard finishing move onto a ledge.</P>
            <P><b>7. Tean Dream (7a+) </b>good sustained face to a mean overlap.</P>
            <P><b>8. Blue View (6c+) </b> the vague blunt arete has a suprisingly tough sequence of moves.</P>
            <P><b>9. The Knew (6c+) &starf;</b> the thin crackline with good moves and a hard finishing move to the belay.</P>
            <P><b>10. The Grey (7a) &starf; </b>the excellent blank-looking face to the right. High steps, crossovers and rockovers. Harder climbed direct.</P>
            <P>The easier routes lie on the walls on the right-hand side of the quarry. The leftmost route is alongisde an impressive 'plank' bolted to the cliff: <b>Still Game (5+) &starf;. </b>further to the right is a long slim groove: <b>Darlton Slab VS 4c </b>takes the pleasant slabby face left of this and <b>Bucket List (5+) </b>takes the faint leftwards trending line around to the right.</P>
