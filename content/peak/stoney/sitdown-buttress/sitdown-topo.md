**5. Sit up and Beg** **(6b)** the excellent face, tough for the grade.

**8. Stand Out Arete (6b)** ★ the well-positioned arete give photogenic climbing.

**10. Christmas Crackers (6c+)** ★ climbs the arete on its right-hand side after the start of Stand Out Arete. Rebolted 

**11. Where's Wall E (6c)** ★ the centre of the wall to the right with a stopper crux.

**12. Berserker Joe (5)** the excellent jamming crack to the right move left to the finish of Christmas Crackers. Can be linked into the top corner of: 

**13. Footprints in the Snow (6a+)** ★ wall to steep corner 

**14. Trouser Ripper (6b+)** problem start on arete then cracks and overlap finish 

**15. Drill Bit Taylor (6b)** tough overlap to crack and leftwards finish 

**16. Mas y Mas (6a)** blocky line to tricky finale 

## Left Bay
{.cb} 

Around to the left of the mainwall is a small, secluded wall in a bay 100m walk away. This gives several routes described from L to R: 

**Taylor's Missing Rib (6a+)** an easy wall to a ledge moving rightwards from the crack to a flying arete.

**Lurcher (E1 5b)** climbs easily up said crack but finish direct up the wall. 

**I Am Seb Grieve (7b)** a direct version of Taylor's Missing Rib. Unusual!

**Hollow Man (6b+)** tricky to below an overlap and a balancy exit to left-hand side of face. **Black Matter (6c)** from the ledge of the previous route,
traverse right above the overlap to a mantel finale. **Black Matter Direct (6c+)** avoid the traverse right by tricky moves straight up. **Still We Ride (6b)** from the shared start moves right below the overlap to gain the fist crack and corner which has a poorer direct start at E2 5c.
