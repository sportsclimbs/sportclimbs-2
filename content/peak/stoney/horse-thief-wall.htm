            <p>A good little wall tucked into the quarry on the left-hand side of the horseshoe bend when coming down the hill from Horseshoe Quarry. It has ease of access, dries very quickly and gets the sun until about 4pm </p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>

            <p>After passing the turning for Horseshoe Quarry, when coming down the hill, a right-hand turn will be seen just before the horseshoe bend. Drive up this, best done when approaching from Horseshoe Quarry, and there a few parking places on the left. Walk down the lane, cross over the road and the crag is 100m down from the lane on the opposite side of the road.</p>
