A small crag hidden in the trees opposite to the Triglyph Buttress at Stoney Middleton. Although hidden by trees, it offers a handful of short routes on good quarried rock. Facing east it gets very little sunlight and can be damp during humid weather or after rain. Discoverd by Nick Taylor and routes 1-10 climbed by Nick and John Allen (what's he done on grit?). Second batch by G Gibson

## Approach

From the parking spot of Darlton Quarry, follow the track up into the quarry i.e. up the track and over the barrier to the left. Do not turn into the quarry but follow the left-hand side of the quarry past the quarry buildings and downwards to an obvious sign depicting a public path then going up into the trees to the right. Follow this for 20m before ascending the slope directly - can be slipper - until the walls can be seen. If followed, this track brings up to an overlook into Goddards Quarry
