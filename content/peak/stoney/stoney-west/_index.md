<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Newly cleaned up with a number of new sport climbs as well as a re-cleaning of existing traditional routes should make this a popular venue.</p>

## Approaches

{{< low-co2 bus-stop="stoney-middleton">}}

The nearest railway station is Grindleford which is 6km away or 21 mins by bike from the crag. 

Leave the station and turn right (south) on Station Road. After 500m join the B6521 (New Road). Cross over the Derwent river and carry on through Grindleford. Follow this road for about 2.5km past a parking area on the right. Take the next right, about 200m past the parking, into Eyam. Follow the main road, The Dale (B6521) south out of Eyam to the A623. Turn R here and follow the main road past sharp RH bend. Continue up the road for about 500m. There is a raised parking area on the right that precedes the footpath into the quarry.

The Eyam to Stoney Middleton bus service stops on the A623 where it meets The Dale. The gate into Cucklet Delf (below) is about about 200m up the A623 (ie. west or away from Stoney M) on the righthand side.

### By car

When heading west on the A623 pass through Stoney Middleton village, past the main crag on the right and past the turn off to Eyam and Stoney quarry. About 100 yards past the turn off look out for the entrance to Tarmac quarry on the left. Immediately after this is a parking spot on the left, opposite a wooden gate on the other side of the road.

Go through the gate leading into Cucklet Delf and the nature reserve. After 50 yards a path on the left winds its way up the hillside until a move around onto the roadside gains a zig-zag path leading to the right-hand side of the crag.

Please do NOT take a direct route up to the cliff from the road.</p>
