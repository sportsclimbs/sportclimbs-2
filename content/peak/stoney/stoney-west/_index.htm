    <p>Libation, a tricky 6b+ at Stoney West.</p>
</div>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Newly cleaned up with a number of new sport climbs as well as a re-cleaning of existing traditional routes should make this a popular venue.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>When heading west on the A623 pass through Stoney Middleton village, past the main crag on the right and past the turn off to Eyam and Stoney quarry. About 100 yards past the turn off look out for the entrance to Tarmac quarry on the left. Immediately after this is a parking spot on the left, opposite a wooden gate on the other side of the road.</p>

<p>Go through the gate leading into Cucklet Delf and the nature reserve. After 50 yards a path on the left winds its way up the hillside until a move around onto the roadside gains a zig-zag path leading to the right-hand side of the crag.</p>

<p class="alert boldcaps">Please do NOT take a direct route up to the cliff from the road.</p>
