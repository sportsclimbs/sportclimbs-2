![the rock at Deep Rake](/img/peak/stoney/deep-rake-closeup.jpg) Deep Rake is a true 'hole in the ground'. It was previously used for lead and fluorspar mining and was rediscovered by climbers in 2018. The best lines were soon ticked off by Lucian Cottle the Lee brothers who did a great job cleaning, cementing and even bolting bits of the crag together to create a high quality sport crag.

The climbing style is unlike other climbing in this area and more like the climbing in some of the Matlock quarries. The yellow rock varies from a rough surface veneer to the extremely smooth frictionless underlayer. 

## Aspect

The main wall (Stemple Wall) faces south and goes into the shade around 3pm in the summer. Hanging wall faces north so is shady all day. The crag dries out quickly after rain. The crag gets no sun in winter though some bits can still remain dry.

## Approach

From the Calver crossroad drive south on the B6001 to Hassop. After 1km you reach the brow of the hill where there is parking on the left side of the road at a vague cross roads. Go up the track on the opposite side of the road for about 500m until you can see the quarry across the fields on the left. Go through gates and across to some footpegs on the northeast fence post to allow you to cross without weighting the wire. This is the only parking you should use. The crag should no longer be approached from the road through Rowland since this will cause access problems.

Old directions

From Calver head south on the B6001 towards Bakewell. After a few miles enter the village of Hassop and take the first right towards Great Longstone. After about a mile take the first right turn to Rowland. Drive through the village and carry on along a narrow paved road. This splits into two with a gravel track going up sharply left. Carry on straight on to a parking place on the L under some trees.

Continue up the gravel road until this splits into two just after a cattle feeding station on the right. Look for a stile on the right which gives access to the footpath. Follow this for several hundred metres and take the track to the left to the east side of Deep Rake . Use the stile at the far end to hop over the fence and come back to the steep path with an old climbing rope that leads down to the bottom. Stemple Wall is on the right and Hanging Wall on the left. -->
