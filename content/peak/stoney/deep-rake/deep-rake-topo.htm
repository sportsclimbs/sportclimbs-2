            <h2>Stemple Wall</h2>

            <p>This is the main wall named after the miner’s stemples which left holes in the wall. These are most visible at the RH end. Routes are described from left to right.</p>

            <p><b>1. Great British Rake Off (6a) </b> the leftmost route starts up the left leaning crack.</p>
            <p><b>2. In Deep (6a) </b> from the first bolt of <em>Rake Off</em> go R and up the wall via the obvious dodgy looking flake. Lotsa bolts.</p>
            <p><b>3. Raking Liberties (6c) *</b> starts just left of the big blocky flake.</p>
            <p><b>4. Rake It In (6b+) *</b> from atop the block take the left line of bolts.</p>
            <p><b>5. Lead Vein Thrombosis (7a) *</b> take the right line.</p>
            <p><b>6. Reliquary (7a+) **</b> climbs the obvious layback feature.</p>
            <p><b>7. Couch to 8a (7b) **</b> </p>
            <p><b>Metal and Dust (7b+) **</b> climbs <em>Couch</em> to the break by the 4th bolt then steps R to finish up Ant Lion.</p>
            <p><b>8. Quatermass and the Pit (7b) *</b>From the 1st bolt on Couch traverse R to the obvious rail then up the wall to finish up the groove.</p>
            <p><b>9. Ant Lion (7c) *</b>crosses <em>Quatermass</em>. Climb direct to the rail, move up and L and direct up the wall.</p>
            <p><b>Ant and the Pit (7b+) *</b> uses <em>Ant</em> as a direct start into <em>Quatermass</em>. </p>
            <p><b>10. My Body is a Stemple (7b) **</b> takes the line L of <em>Rake’s</em> via the short crack.</p>
            <p><b>11. Rake’s Progress (7a) *</b> is the last line on the front face.</p>
            <p><b>12. Dirty Tow’d Man (6b+) </b> starts up and R of Rake’s Progress up the grey rock to R of the the arete.</p>
            <p><b>Exstemplary (6b+) </b> is a L to R traverse of the whole wall. Climb <em>Great British Rake Off</em> to the 3rd bolt then head up rightwards to gain the obvious break. Follow this to <em>My Body is a Stemple</em> and go up one bolt before continuing right into, and finishing up, <em>Dirty T’owd Man</em>.</p>

            <h2>Hanging Wall</h2>

            <p>The north facing wall has some worthwhile routes. The steep access is made easier by some in situ ropes to pull on.</p>

            <p><b>1. Rake News (6a+)</b> follows the broken crack line.</p>
            <p><b>2. Chossword (6b)</b> takes the face just R of Rake News.</p>
            <p><b>3. Fat Lad Exam Failure (6a+)</b> climbs the twin cracks.</p>
