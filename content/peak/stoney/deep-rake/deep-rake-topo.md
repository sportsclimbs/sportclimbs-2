## Stemple Wall

![Stemple Wall topo.](/img/peak/stoney/deep-rake-stemple-wall.jpg)
{.topo}

This is the main wall named after the miner’s stemples which left holes in the wall. These are most visible at the righthand end. Routes are described from left to right.
{.csa}

**1. Great British Rake Off (6a)**  
The leftmost route starts up the left leaning crack.
{.mt0}

**2. In Deep (6a)**  
From the first bolt of _Rake Off_ go R and up the wall via the obvious dodgy looking flake. Lotsa bolts.

**3. Raking Liberties (6c) *★***  
Start just left of the big blocky flake.

**4. Rake It In (6b+) *★***  
From atop the block take the left line of bolts.

**5. Lead Vein Thrombosis (7a) *★***  
From atop the block take the right line of bolts.

**6. Reliquary (7a+) *★★***  
Climbs the obvious layback feature.

**7. Couch to 8a (7b) *★★***
The smooth wall proves tricky.

**Metal and Dust (7b+) *★★***  
Climb _Couch_ to the break by the 4th bolt then step right to finish up *Ant Lion*.

**8. Quatermass and the Pit (7b) *★***  
From the 1st bolt on Couch traverse right to the obvious rail then up the wall to finish up th*e groove.

**9. Ant Lion (7c) *★***  
This crosses _Quatermass_. Climb direct to the rail, move up and left and direct up the wall.

**Ant and the Pit (7b+) *★***  
Use _Ant Lion_ as a direct start into _Quatermass_.

**10. My Body is a Stemple (7b) *★★***  
Takes the line left of _Rake’s Progress_ via the short crack. Low in the grade.

**11. Rake’s Progress (7a) *★***  
The last line on the front face is now trickier since loss of holds.

**12. Dirty Tow’d Man (6b+)**  
Starts up and right of *Rake’s Progress* up the grey rock to R of the the arête.

**Exstemplary (6b+)**  
A left to right traverse of the whole wall. Climb _Great British Rake Off_ to the 3rd bolt then head up rightwards to gain the obvious break. Follow this to _My Body is a Stemple_ and go up one bolt before continuing right into, and finishing up, _Dirty T’owd Man_.

## Hanging Wall

![Deep Rake Hanging Wall](/img/peak/stoney/deep-rake-hanging-wall.jpg)
{.topo}

The north facing wall has some worthwhile routes. The steep access is made easier by some in situ ropes to pull on.
{.csa}

**1. Rake News (6a+)**  
follows the broken crack line.
{.mt0}

**2. Chossword (6b)**  
takes the face just R of Rake News.

**3. Fat Lad Exam Failure (6a+)**  
climbs the twin cracks.
