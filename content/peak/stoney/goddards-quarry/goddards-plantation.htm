<h2>The Plantation</h2>
<P>This wall is situated further into the quarry. Turn right past the initial wall and walk past the impressive (and collapsing) walls before following a grassy bank leftwards to the face. Easy to find. 5 minutes.</P>

    <P>On the far left of this wall is an isolated route with a testing first 10m:<B> Fingers Away (6b) </B>whilst to the right is a good little wall <b>Let's See those Fingers </b>(6b)</P>
    <P><B>1. Crozzles Away (6b) </B>tricky start then peculiar calcite tumps.</P>
    <P><B>2. Pebbles Away (6b) </B>tricky thick crack moving rightwards to second crack. <b>Direct finish (6b+)</b></P>
    <P><b>2a. Name not Known (5)</b> an awful route on the right edge of the wall. </P>
    <P><B>3. Unbroken (7b) </B>shallow groove moving leftwards to desperate boulder problem finale. Harder since loss of crucial crimp.</P>
    <P><b>3a. Name not Known (6b+) * </b>excellent climbing via the blunt rib and short wall. Good </P>
    <P><B>4. Careless Tooth (6c) * </B>leftwards from ledge to technical and fingery wall.</P>
    <P><B>5. Not to be Drunken Away (7a+) </B>straight up wall with hideous move at overlap.</P>
    <P><B>6. Heir Pit (6c+) </B>* easy start over blocks then fine technical face and overlap.</P>
    <P><B>7. The Bit Man (7a) </B>block to ledge then technical lower wall.</P>
    <P><B>8. Big Hare (6c+) </B>fingery wall above large block. Worthwhile.</P>
    <P><B>9. Debrilliant (6c) * </B>good climbing leftwards and then up the centre of the wall. Sustained</P>
    <P><B>10. Careless Talc (6b+) * </B>good climbing straight up the right-hand side of the wall. Hard finish. </P>
    <P>Further right is an arete. <b>Mup me (5+) </b>climbs the groove on its left and <b>Strong Like Horse (6a) </b>is the arete. Right again in a bay is <b>Tree Twister (6a+) *.</b></P>
