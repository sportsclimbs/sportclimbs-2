            <p>At the far end of the quarry most of the rock is loose and unclimbable. There are a number of more solid walls that have been and still are being developed. These face the opposite direction to most of the walls in Goddard's and so catch the sun making climbing possible here even on winter's days.</p>

                <p>An good wall at the far end of the quarry above the lower tier and reached by traversing in from the left. Open and in the sun with some good routes.</p>
