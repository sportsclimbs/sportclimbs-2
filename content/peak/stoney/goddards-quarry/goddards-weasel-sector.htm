    <p>This area is approached by walking past the main wall. Pass a smaller wall on the left and high up on the left is this buttress. Access is by scrambling up the scree via a fixed rope and then back left to beneath the routes.</p>

    <P>The corner around to the left is<b> Boy Better Know (6a) *</b></P>
    <P><b>1. Weasel Assassin (7a+) </b>technical and fingery face climbing on small holds on the left side of the wall.</P>
    <P><b>2. Psycho Squirrel (7b) </b>the harder right-hand line, particularly so around the overlaps at 8m.</P>
    <P><b>3. Stoatily Obvious (6b+) </b>leftwards line from blocky start via corner and tricky finish above slab</P>
    <P><b>4. Weasily Identifiable (6b+) </b>the right-hand line starting the same. Pity about the start.</P>

    <P>Around to the right is a gully which can be gained via a fixed rope:</P>
    <P><b>1. Skyfall (6b+) * </b>is the big hanging arete and crack: very photogenic</P>
    <P><b>2. Buzzards Banquet (6a) </b>is the offwidth crack</P>
    <P><b>3.</b> <b>Billy Bunter (5) </b>is the slab</P>
    <P><b>4. Architects Glasses (6a) </b>is the left-hand side of the rib </P>
    <P><b>5.</b> <b>Bon Marche (6a) </b>strict eliminate but good climbing</P>
    <P>Right again in the trees is a small wall:</P>
    <P><b>Niggestone (6a+) </b> is the front of the buttress with a right-hand variant <b>Knuckle Fucker (6a)</b>, the diagonal line is <b>Murmeration (6a) *, Banana Boat (5+) </b>is the cracks and the slim pillar is <b>Pleather Madonna (6c)</b>. To the right is a poor route across the crozzly fac at 6b.</P>
    <P>The back left-hand corner of the quarry on an arete are: <b>Taco Bell (6b), </b>the featured right-hand face is <b>Unnamed (6a+). </b>Right again is a <b>Project</b> with a very hard start and right again is<b> Top Knots and Tats (6a). </b>Further right is an orange tower with a grotty start,<b> hence Orange Tower (6c+) </b>a very testing final move.</P>
