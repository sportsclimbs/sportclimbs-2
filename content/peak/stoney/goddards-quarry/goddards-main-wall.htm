            <P>Around the corner as you make your way along the crag are three routes: </P>
            <P><b>Tower of Pain (6a) </b>the first tower as you walk into the quarry.</P>
            <P><b>1. By Goddard (6c) </b>takes a slim pillar with good technical moves, more sustained than cruxy </P>
            <P><b>2. Sheffield Tape Archive(6a+)</b> a long slim arete finishing high on the cliff.</P>

            <P><b>1 15 Steps (6c+) &starf;&starf; </b>the huge hanging arete in the centre of the big decaying-looking walls. Superb climbing, a little dusty low down but magnificent positions high up. </P>
            <P><b>2. Neon Boneyard (6b+) &starf; </b>a long and very fine route taking a cracked arete and fine headwall. Still needs a couple more bolts. Stick clip for now.</P>
            <P>The next four routes are gained via an in-situ rope leading up to them. They are still a little dusty at their base.</P>
            <P><b>3. Testing the Fossil (7a) </b>a tricky sequence above the second bolt and one hard move high up.</P>
            <P><b>4. Fossilized (6c) </b>the right-hand of the two lines has a hard move low down/</P>
            <P><b>5. Crinoid Corner (6a+) </b>the big corner line</P>
            <P><b>6. Amanitas (6c+) </b> the flowstone arete.</P>
            <P><b>New Facts Emerge (6b+) &starf; </b>the big arete left of Goddard's Corner. </P>
            <P><b>7. Goddards Corner (6a+) </b>the long corner line with gained via a short introductory wall. Needs more traffic. <b>Dave Simmonite</b></P>
            <P><b>8. Oh My Goddard (7a+) </b>a long with plenty of tricky moves and a real atmosphere to it: stay out of the corner. Tough</P>
            <P><b>9. For Goddard's Sake (7a+) </b>more of the same right again with hard moves from the overhang onwards. Intimidating</P>
