![The layout of Goddards Quarry](/img/peak/stoney/goddards-plan.jpg)

This huge quarry is just across the road from the Stoney Middleton crags. Hop over the stile opposite to the garage and follow the public footpath up to the first wall, Crustacean Wall, in 100m.
            
For the remainder of the routes, follow the path into the main quarry passing the huge Main Wall on the left.
