Goddard’s Quarry is easily accessible addition to the Stoney Middleton crags, located on the opposite side of the road to Garage Buttress.

Hop over the stile opposite to the garage and follow the public footpath up to the first wall in 100m.

For the remainder of the routes, continue rightwards into the main quarry past some big walls, containing one single route, to some grassy slopes on the left. Wander up these to a grassy meadow below another good wall.

## Aspect

Most of the walls are shady in the morning and don't get sun until mid to late afternoon. The aptly named Sunshine Wall faces the opposite way and gets plenty of sun. Most of the walls dry relatively quickly after rain.

## Approaches

{{< low-co2 bus-stop="stoney-middleton">}}

The nearest railway station is Grindleford which is 4.9km or 18m by bike from the crag. 

Leave the station and turn right (south) on Station Road. After 500m join the B6521 (New Road). Cross over the Derwent river and carry on through Grindleford. Follow this road for 3km to where the road bends round to the right. At the bend go straight on here onto Jacobs Ladder until you meet the main road (A623) in Stoney Middleton. Turn right here, pass some cliffs on the right and a parking area on the left. A little further on there is a large wooden gate and a stile opposite the garage. Cross the stile and follow the path for about 100m. Crustacean wall is straight in front.

### By Car

When heading westwards on the A623 pass through the village of Stoney Middleton, past the Little India cafe on the right. Just past this on the left side of the road is a good parking area. Walk up The Dale a short way to a large wooden gate and a stile opposite the Garage. Hop over this and follow the path for about 100 metres. The wall is directly in front.
