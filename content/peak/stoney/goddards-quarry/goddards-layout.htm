            <P>This huge quarry is just across the road from the Stoney Middleton crags. Hop over the stile opposite to the garage and follow the public footpath up to the first wall in 100m.</P>
            
            <P>For the remainder of the routes, continue into the main quarry and the big Main Wall is obvious.</P>
