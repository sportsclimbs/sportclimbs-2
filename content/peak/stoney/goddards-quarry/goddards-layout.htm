            <P>A new crag has been developed in the quarry opposite to Garage Buttress. Hop over the stile opposite to the garage and follow the public footpath up to the first wall in 100m.</P>
            <P>For the remainder of the routes, continue rightwards into the main quarry past some big walls, containing one single route, to some grassy slopes on the left. Wander up these to a grassy meadow below another good wall.</P>
