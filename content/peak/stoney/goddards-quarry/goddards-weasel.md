This area is approached by walking past the main wall. Pass a smaller wall on the left and high up on the left is this buttress. Access is by scrambling up the scree to the right of the wall. A fixed rope marks the line. Then move back left to beneath the routes.

**1. Boy Better Know (6a) *★***  
The corner around to the left. 

**2. Weasel Assassin (7a) *★***  
Technical and fingery face climbing on small holds on the left side of the wall.

**3. Psycho Squirrel (7a) *★***  
The harder right-hand line, particularly so around the overlaps at 8m. 4BRs.

**4. Stoatily Obvious (6b+)**  
Leftwards line from blocky start via corner and tricky finish above slab.

**5. Weasily Identifiable (6b+)**  
The right-hand line starting the same. Pity about the start.

**Banana Boat (5+)**  
Is the cracks. 

**Pleather Madonna (6c)**  
The slim pillar. 


To the right is a poor route **Across the Crozzly Fac (6b)**. The back left-hand corner of the quarry on an arête are: **Taco Bell (6b)** the featured right-hand face is **Unnamed (6a+).** Right again is a **Project** with a very hard start and right again is **Top Knots and Tats (6a).** Further right is an orange tower with a grotty start, hence **Orange Tower (6c+)** a very testing final move.
