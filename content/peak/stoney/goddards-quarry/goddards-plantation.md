This wall is situated further into the quarry. Turn right past the initial wall and walk past the impressive (and collapsing) walls before following a grassy bank leftwards to the face. Easy to find. 5 minutes.

On the far left of this wall is an isolated route with a testing first 10m: **Fingers Away (6b)** 
whilst to the right is a good little wall **Let's See those Fingers (6b)**.
{.csa}

**1. Crozzles Away (6b)**  
tricky start then peculiar calcite tumps.
{.mt0}

**2. Pebbles Away (6b)**  
tricky thick crack moving rightwards to second crack. **Direct finish (6b+)**

**2a. Name not Known (5)**  
an awful route on the right edge of the wall.

**3. Unbroken (7b)**  
shallow groove moving leftwards to desperate boulder problem finale. Harder since loss of crucial crimp.

**3a. Name not Known (6b+) *★***  
excellent climbing via the blunt rib and short wall. Good

**4. Careless Tooth (6c) *★***  
leftwards from ledge to technical and fingery wall.

**5. Not to be Drunken Away (7a+)**  
straight up wall with hideous move at overlap.

**6. Heir Pit (6c+) *★***   
easy start over blocks then fine technical face and overlap.

**7. The Bit Man (7a)**  
block to ledge then technical lower wall.

**8. Big Hare (6c+)**  
fingery wall above large block. Worthwhile.

**9. Debrilliant (6c) *★***  
good climbing leftwards and then up the centre of the wall. Sustained

**10. Careless Talc (6b+) *★***  
good climbing straight up the right-hand side of the wall. Hard finish.

Further right is an arête. **Mup me (5+)** climbs the groove on its left and **Strong Like Horse (6a)** is the arête. Right again in a bay is **Tree Twister (6a+) *★*** .

A further 50m to the right is a compact calcite wall.
