Main Wall is defined sharply at the lefthand side by the obvious arete of *Pale Rider* and somewhat arbitarily by the thin crack of *Spring Awakening* on the right. It can be hard to find the routes at first. The most obvious lines are *The Leading Line*, a fracture line that runs the full height of the crag towards the left side, and the long borehole of *Shot Yer Bolt* on the right.

**1. Pale Rider (6a)** &starf; The warm up. Keep to the arete, not the crack on the right.

**2. Rain Dance (6c)** &starf;&starf; Tricky start then delicate above and rightwards. The two left-hand finishes are **Colostomy Finish (6c+)** and **Physical Fizz (6c+)**

**3. School's Out (6a+)** &starf; New start and bouldery crux to excellent faint crackline

**4. Rotund Rooley (6b)** &starf; Pleasant delicate climbing via the obvious scoop. Becoming polished and hence insecure.

**5. Waves of Mutilation (7a)** Desperate sequence past ring BR. New finish.

**6. First Day of Winter HVS 5b** the excellent crackline running almost the full height of the wall has a difficult start and finishes via a groove slightly right.

**7. Wall of Jericho (6b)** &starf; Rebolted and one of the easiest on this section of wall.

**8. The Leading Line (6b+)** &starf; The obvious crackline gives monkey-up-a-stick climbing. Worthwhile.

**9. Say it With Flowers (6c)** &starf; Again pleasant with one hard and awkward move. 

**10. Legal Action (6c)** &starf;&starf; Hard start with pleasant face above. Airy.

**11. Run for your Wife (6c+)** &starf;&starf; One of the best on the wall. Crux low down leaving a prominent flake and superb above. 

**12. Private Prosecution (6c)** &starf;&starf; Superb blend of technical and airy climbing via shallow groove, scoop and headwall.. 

**13. Litany Against Fear (6c)** &starf; Now climbed direct over the bulge. A superb and technical direct finish.

**Mega Shot (7a)** climbs the shothole L of Megalithic Man from the fourth bolt on that route and utilizing the last 2 bolts on that route too. The crux can be avoided by going further L at 6c.

**14. Megalithic Man (6b+)** &starf;&starf; A fine route, bold low down finishing left and up from the 5th BR. The< **Super Direct Finish** is a fingery direct finish at 6c+ &starf;&starf;.

**15. Poisonality (7a)** &starf; Effectively the direct start to An Ancient Rhythm with fine moves. 

**16. An Ancient Rhythm (6c+)** &starf; A hard start leads to open climbing and a finish via the thin crack. The link pitch between this and the next route gives **Ancient Man E5 6a** &starf; connects Rhythm with Demolition Man

**17. Demolition Man (7a)** &starf; A mixture of technical low down, easy middle and fluttery finish.

**18. Shot Yer Bolt (6b+)** &starf;&starf; The obvious borehole with a tricky finish and rattling hold.

**19. Southern Man (7b)** &starf;&starf; Superb route with blind and fingery finish. Hard since loss of holds and worth a flutter sign .

**20. Nice Ledge, Shame about the Face (6c)** &starf; Awkward start. Difficult slab move and airy finish. 

**21. Flatworld (7a)** &starf; Open technical face with brutish finish off edge.

**22. Lost Monolith (6b+)** the long straightforward crackline and difficult final bulge.

**23. Screwy Driver E1 5b** the shallow groove/crack line to the right with a difficult final section.

**Harvey Wallbanger (6c)** an eliminate up the wall just L of *Spring Awakening*. Climb direct through overlap at the top. Using the crack out right near the top makes it a more balanced 6b.

**24. Spring Awakening E1 5b**  the straight thin crack has been subject to recent cleaning work to the right. It has affected the grade slightly but was reclimbed a couple of days after the cleaning. It has now been completely recleaned.
