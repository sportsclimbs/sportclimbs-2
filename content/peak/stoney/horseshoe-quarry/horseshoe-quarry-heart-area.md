This is the steep buttress to the left of The Slabs. Facing NE it gets little sun and is good for a hot day though takes longer to dry out that other parts of the crag.

The most prominent lines are the two left leaning crack lines of *Heart to Heart* and *Sliver* (routes 5 & 6). The routes on the right side start from ledges that you scramble up to via fixed ropes.
