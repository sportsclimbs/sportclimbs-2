These are obvious and situated at the back of the quarry, facing you as you walk in. Their appearance is initially not very attractive but the climbing is good open face climbing and easy in the sport climbing grades. Some lines can be climbed as multipitch routes (those with 2 grades) though they can also be climbed as single pitches too. This wall is popular and well climbed on but loose rock is still an issue and wearing a helmet here is a good idea.
