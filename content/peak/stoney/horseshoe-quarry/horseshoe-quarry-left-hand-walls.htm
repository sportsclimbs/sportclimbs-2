            <p>The left-hand side of these wall terminates in an impressive orange coloured buttress complete with numerous excavation marks</p>

            <p><b>2. Sahara (6b+) </b>arete in back corner of bay. Friable and unpopular.</p>

            <p><b>15. Senter Home (5+)</b> slab with hard moves through overlap. A right-hand upper variant is 6a </p>

            <p><b>17. Mailon Sunday (6b)</b> pleasant climbing with a tricky step right and dogleg back left. </p>

            <p><b>20. Fouls Bane (6a)</b> first wall right of long slim corner, actually uses corner on occasions. </p>
            <p><b>21. Drool Rock Worm (6b)</b> the wall to the left of the borehole to the right. Finish alongside tree. </p>
            <p><b>22. Stonethroat (6b+)</b> * Direct line just right of the borehole. Pleasant face climbing. </p>

            <p>The central section of the walls can be identified by an elder tree towards the top of the cliff with a prominent borehole beneath it</p>
            <p><b>24. Mr. Cellulite's Arete (6a+)</b> Short sharp arete to the right. Long reach at grade.</p>
            <p><b>25. Bandolier (6a)</b> Long corner line to the right, avoiding ledge on right, has cleaned up.</p>
            <p><b>26. Underslung (6b+) </b>wall to right with low crux and sustained interest above ledge.</p>
            <p><b>27. The Little Thin Mexican around the Border (6b)</b> the wall to the right with awkward moves on the lower. Keep on the left-hand side of the short arete</p>
            <p><b>28. Desperate Measures (6b)</b> line via wall to right with hard moves on right-hand of arete</p>
            <p><b>29. The Mexican Takes Lexicon (6a+) </b>the slim wall to the right direct. Another route that has cleaned up.</p>
            <p><b>30. Exceeding the Speed Limit (6b+)</b> * very pleasant line on wall to the right and in the back of the bay. Just worth grade</p>
            <p><b>31. Mind yer Head (6b) </b>fragile line 2m left of slim corner line. Slowly improving.</p>
            <p><b>32. Desperate Housewives (6a) </b>the slim corner line</p>
            <p><b>33. Collared (6a)</b> the slim pillar to the right with straightforward but sustained moves </p>
            <p><b>34. Spare Rib (6b)</b> vague blunt rib to the right with a hard and devious start</p>
            <p><b>35. Eddie McStiff (6a+) * </b>shallow groove line exiting leftwards and up via easier ground. A good addition.</p>
            <p><b>36. Pelvic Thrust (6b) </b>tricky lower wall via small arete to face above </p>
            <p><b>37. The Hippy, Hippy Shakes (6b) </b>long slim corner line to high belay</p>

            <p><b>41. Austin Powers (6b)</b> slim groove in arete and wall above. Can be combined with the next route.</p>
            <p><b>42. The Big Fat Texan on a Corner (6a+ ) * </b> the white wall to the right keeping as direct to the line of bolts as possible. Popular but harder than expected.</p>
            <p><b>43. He Seems so Sumo (6a)</b> the crakline/shothole to the right gives sustained climbing.</p>
            <p><b>44. Olive Oil (5) </b>the left wall of corner. Worthwhile. </p>
            <p><b>45. Removal Man (5)</b> the chimney in the corner </p>
