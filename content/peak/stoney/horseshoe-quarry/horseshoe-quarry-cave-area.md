The Cave area is the first main area when entering the quarry. It's easily identified by the small cave some 6m above the ground (best seen in the second topo on this page). 

The first topo covers the walls left of the cave up to and into the Androids sector on the left. The second and third topos cover the area right of the cave, affectionately known as the Toilet area.

## The Toilet Area

When the early pioneers of Horseshoe first climbed here all the action was on the Main wall. This particular area was thought to be of such bad quality that no one would ever climb here. So it was designated as the place to relieve oneself during a hard day of new routing. Today it has been well bolted and its popularity mean most of the poor quality rock has been pulled off.
