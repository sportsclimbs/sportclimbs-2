            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>The quarry is situated about 2km up the A623 from Stoney Middleton. Follow the
                road and 300m after a sharp right-hand bend will be seen a quarry track leading
                off to the right with a lay-by on the left-hand side of the road 100m further
                on. Park here or on the opposite side of the road. Go back down the road and follow
                the track into the quarry.</p>


            <h3>Layout</h3>

            <p>On entering the quarry the first walls seen at the back of the quarry are clearly recognized by a cave at 10m and a compact wall extending leftwards. 20m left of the cave is the first area (Androids Area) identified by a long corner line. The best area, the Main Wall, lies 70m to the left and is obvious by name. The walls extend beyond this for some distance and then form a series of slabs on the back wall. On the left-hand side of this and facing towards the main wall are a yellowish wall (Heart to heart Wall) and a bay (Guoranga Bay). Above the Main Wall lies the recently developed Upper Tier.</p>
