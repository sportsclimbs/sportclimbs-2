These topos cover the area right of the prominent cave at half height. Now affectionately known as the Toilet area it was once literally the toilet area for early Horseshoe pioneers who thought the rock here was so poor no one would ever climb here. It's since grown into one of the Peak district's most popular crags and hundreds of ascents have pulled off *most* of the bad rock. However the odd blocks can still work loose so take care and look out for white crosses which signify loose rock. Wearing a helmet here is still a good idea.
