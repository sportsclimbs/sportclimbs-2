## Approach

The Upper Tier is best approached by taking the high righthand path which splits off from the main path into the quarry before entering the quarry proper.

There are 5 topos on this page listed in left to right order and numbered from 1 on the left to 5 on the far right. There are also a few more routes on the [Africa Buttress Upper](/peak/stoney/horseshoe-quarry/horseshoe-africa#africa-upper) section.

## 1. Upper Tier far left

If you follow the Upper Tier terrace the continuous rock wall eventually runs out to a more vegetated and broken section. Carry on past this to where the rock is more continuous again with a series of slim walls and corners.

N.B. the very far left of the Upper Tier is covered by the [Africa Buttress](/peak/stoney/horseshoe-quarry/horseshoe-africa/) page. Some of the routes there are best approached by climbing up from below or abseiling in from above.
