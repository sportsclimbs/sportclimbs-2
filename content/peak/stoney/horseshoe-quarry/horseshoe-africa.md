            <p>The heavily excavated walls in the top right-hand corner of the quarry. So called because they look like Africa but not in the desert wasteland sense.</p>

            <p><b>1. Elizabethville (6a)</b> short line on left-hand side of ledge.</p>
            <p><b>2. Burundi (6b)</b> short line via thin crack and one hard move.</p>
            <p><b>3. Townships (6c+) </b>short desperate route</p>
            <p><b>4. Victoria Falls (6a)</b> crackline via sharp layaway edge. Easy in grade.</p>
            <p><b>5. Kariba (6a+) </b>thin crackline. One hard move.</p>
            <p><b>6. Zanzibar (6b)</b> slab on right. Step out of Kariba at 5m.</p>
            <p><b>7. Simonstown (6c+) *</b> right-hand line on slab with one very trying move. Only one route here.</p>
            <p><b>8. Out of Africa (6b+)</b> left-hand side of lower arete avoiding crack on left.</p>
            <p><b>9. Madagascar (6b)</b> one move wonder on right-hand side of arete.</p>
            <p><b>10. Bird Island (6a, 6a)</b> poor lower corner with pleasant upper arete pitch. </p>
            <p><b>11. Seychelles (6b)</b> a good crack climb requiring traffic to clean it up a little more. </p>
            <p><b>12. Rainbow Warrior (6c, 6a)</b> * </b>fine lower wall just left of arete with a difficult pull and awkward overlap.</p>
            <p><b>13. Weakened Warrior (6b) </b></b>rounded arete right of Rainbow Warrior. </p>
            <p><b>14. Sam in you Eye (6a+) </b>pleasant orange wall which will clean up.</p>
            <p><b>15. Ring Thane(6c+) **</b> the superb upper arete line has now been bolted</p>
            <p><b>16. Pretoria (6b+)</b> the right-hand side of upper arete. </p>
            <p><b>17. Mombassa (6a)</b> the upper corner line. </p>
            <p><b> 18. Greenpeace (6a)</b> the slab to the right of the corner now seems contrived.</p>
