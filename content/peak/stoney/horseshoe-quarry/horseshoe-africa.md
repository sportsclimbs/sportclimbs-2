This is the heavily excavated buttress in the top right-hand corner of the quarry. It's bounded on the left side by the huge grassy scree slope that separate it from The Slabs. So called because it looks like Africa but not in the desert wasteland sense.

The upper walls can be approached via the Upper tier approach or by climbing one of the pitches below and creating a multipitch adventure.

**1. Out of Africa (6b+)**  
Takes the left-hand side of lower arete avoiding crack on left.

**2. Madagascar (6b)**  
A one move wonder on right-hand side of arete.

**3. Bird Island pitch 1 (6a)**  
Climb the up the wall to gain the obvious corner. Climb this on to the Upper tier ledge and a belay. An easy way to gain access to this part of the Upper tier.

**4. Seychelles (6b)**  
A good crack climb requiring traffic to clean it up a little more.

**5. Rainbow Warrior (6c) *&starf;***    
Climb the fine lower wall just left of arete to a difficult pull over the roof.

**6. Weakened Warrior (6b)**  
The rounded arete right of Rainbow Warrior.

**7. Sam in you Eye (6a+)**  
The pleasant orange wall which will clean up with more ascents.

**8. During the War (6a+)**  
Climbs the wide crack left of the corner.

**9. Before the War (5)**  
The obvious corner.

**10. Sahara (6b+)**  
The arete in the back corner of the bay. Firable and unpopular.


## Africa Upper

These walls are the extreme left end of the Upper Tier. They can be approached via the normal Upper Tier approach which begins by taking the right fork in the path before entering the quarry proper. Alternatively one can approach by climbing a pitch on the lower walls up to the ledges at the foot of upper section.

The first 7 routes start from a ledge. This can be gained by climbing one of the routes below or abseiling in from the top.

**1. Elizabethville (6a)**  
The leftmost line on left-hand side of ledge.

**2. Burundi (6b)**  
Another short route via thin crack with one hard move.

**3. Townships (6c+)**  
A short desperate route.

**4. Victoria Falls (6a)**  
Takes the crackline via sharp layaway edge. Easy in grade.

**5. Kariba (6a+)**  
The steep, thin crackline.

**6. Zanzibar (6b)**  
The slab on right. Step out of Kariba at 5m.

**7. Simonstown (6c+) *&starf;***    
The last line starting from the ledge. The righthand line up the slab has one very trying move.

**8. Ring Thane (6c+) *&starf;&starf;***  
Climbs up the left side of the arete. Approach via *Rainbow Warrior* to make a good, 6c multipitch route.

This climbs the right side of the arete.

**10. Mombassa (6a)**  
Start as for *Pretoria* to gain the upper corner line.

**11. Greenpeace (6a)**  
Start as *Mombassa* but climb the slab to the right of the corner. Contrived.
