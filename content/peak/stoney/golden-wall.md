**1. Jumping Blacks (6c+)**  
After a difficult boulder problem start things get easier above the 3rd bolt.

**2. The Blicks (6b)**  
The technical rib leads to a steep fingery finish.

**3. Poison Flowers (6a+)**  
An awkward wall but enjoyable above ledge.

**4. Black Bryony (6b) *★***  
A fine pitch via a blunt rib and pleasant wall.

**5. Blickin' 'eck (6b+) *★***  
An excellent wall. Start just left via edge.

**6. Undiscovered Blacks (5+)**  
A short offering on right gives the wall's easiest route.
