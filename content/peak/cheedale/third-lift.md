Although not noted for its high concentration of difficult climbs, the Third Lift has, over the years, slowly acquired a number of sport routes which make it just worth a visit. Although generally short (12m) it offers some good routes in a fine open position with no seepage problems. Approaches may seem awkward but by skirting around the ridge from the upper Topley Pike car park on the A6, the cliff can be gained in 5 or so minutes. Alternatively, walk rightwards from below Moving Buttress until the cliff is reached.

**1. Fingerpops (7b+)**  
Two desperate moves on nondescript pockets.
{.mt0}

**2. Crank it Up (6c+)**  
The centre of this wall gives good moves and a sharp intake of breath.

**3. An Uplifting Experience (7a)**  
The wall to right without using the flake on right. Tough. Only 6b+ if using the flake on the right.

**4. Access All Areas (7a+) *★***  
A sustained and fingery climb on left edge of wall.

**5. Elephant Talk (7a+) *★***  
Climb the centre of wall direct. Fingery and smeary.

**6. Hamish (7a)**  
Technical and even more fingery.

**7. Five Miles High (6c+) *★***  
The hanging groove is difficutl to enter.

**8. All Fall Down (7a+)**  
The sustained and friable front face. A spooky experience.

**9. High Scream Sunday (6c+) *★★***  
The very photogenic and worthwhile right-hand arete.

**10. The Siberian Hamster (7a) *★***  
A technical and sustained arete with no belay as yet.

**11. All Made Up (7a+)**  
Another technical arete on its right-hand side. Artificial but worthwhile.

**12. Powder Puff (6b)**  
An easier line on the side wall.

**13. Uninspired E3 6 *★a***  
The front face of pinnacle gives good traditional climbing.

**14. Pinnaclised (6c)**  
The right arete after start of *Uninpsired*.
