**1\. I Had a Black Shirt (7a)** vague and slightly artificial line right of arete. Worthwhile.

**2\. Never to Look Back (7b) ★★** classic. Photogenic. Superb climbing on the arete.

**3\. Stax a Time (7b)** hard moves on the left-hand side of the arete. Spaced BRs low down.

**4\. In the Stox (7a)** A worthwhile pitch up the centre of the side wall.

**5\. As Loose as This ? (6c+) ★** solid. A better route to the left. Fingery and sustained.

**6\. No Intent (6b+)** wall and vague groove/flake on left-hand side of wall.

**7\. Guilty (6c)** tricky start to easier ground above half-height ledge.

**8\. The Plea (6a+) ★** a fine little route with pleasant face climbing.

**9\. Witness This (6c+)** intense sequence on right-hand side of side wall. Perfect rock.

**10\. For the Prosecution (6c+)** left-hand side of wall. Poor.

**11\. The Fifth Amendment (6c)** technical start up front of pillar. Good.

**12\. In the Defence (7a)** direct line via pillar with scary last clip followed by the crux.

**13\. Open Verdict (7a+) ★** bouldery start with a mid-height crux. Top end of grade.

**14\. Community Service (6c+) ★** good, sustained line to the left. A bit hollow low down.

**15\. The Jury's Out (6c) ★** pillar at back right-hand corner. Boldish and technical. Good.

**18\. Overclapped (7a+)** tough little cookie through the overlaps.

**19\. Thundertrapped (7a)** short sharp shock via the overlap.

**20\. Happy, Slappy, Chappy (7a)** powerful sequence through overlap.

**21\. Overslapped (7a) ★** excellent technical face to left, no overlap! Best route on this wall.

**23\. Robert's Roberts (7a+)** hard sequence through bulge and short wall via undercut.

**24\. Watch this Space (6c)** short technical face on left. Worthwhile.
