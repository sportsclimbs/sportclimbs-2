**1. I Had a Black Shirt (7a)**  
vague and slightly artificial line right of arête. Worthwhile.

**2. Never to Look Back (7b) *★★***  
Classic. Photogenic. Superb climbing on the arête.

**3. Stax a Time (7b)**  
hard moves on the left-hand side of the arête. Spaced BRs low down.

**4. In the Stox (7a)**  
A worthwhile pitch up the centre of the side wall.

**5. As Loose as This ? (6c+) *★***  
Solid. A better route to the left. Fingery and sustained.

**6. No Intent (6b+)**  
Wall and vague groove/flake on left-hand side of wall.

**7. Guilty (6c)**  
Tricky start to easier ground above half-height ledge.

**8. The Plea (6a+) *★***  
A fine little route with pleasant face climbing.

**9. Witness This (6c+)**  
Intense sequence on right-hand side of side wall. Perfect rock.

**10. For the Prosecution (6c+)**  
Left-hand side of wall. Poor.

**11. The Fifth Amendment (6c)**  
Technical start up front of pillar. Good.

**12. In the Defence (7a)**  
Direct line via pillar with scary last clip followed by the crux.

**13. Open Verdict (7a+) *★***  
Bouldery start with a mid-height crux. Top end of grade.

**14. Community Service (6c+) *★***  
Good, sustained line to the left. A bit hollow low down.

**15. The Jury's Out (6c) *★***  
Pillar at back right-hand corner. Boldish and technical. Good.

**16. Runyonectomy (6b)**  
Short poor wall left of corner.

**17. Megaflapped (6c)**  
via overlap and difficult move on upper wall.

**18. Overclapped (7a+)**  
Tough little cookie through the overlaps.

**19. Thundertrapped (7a)**  
Short sharp shock via the overlap.

**20. Happy, Slappy, Chappy (7a)**  
Powerful sequence through overlap.

**21. Overslapped (7a) *★***  
excellent technical face to left, no overlap! Best route on this wall.

**22. Kill the Bill (7b+)**  
very technical wall to left. Needs rebolting.

**23. Robert's Roberts (7a+)**  
hard sequence through bulge and short wall via undercut.

**24. Watch this Space (6c)**  
Short technical face on left. Worthwhile.
