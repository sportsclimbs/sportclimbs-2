<p><b>1. I Had a Black Shirt (7a)</b> vague and slightly artificial line right of arete. Worthwhile.</p>
<p><b>2. Never to Look Back (7b) &starf;&starf;</b> classic. Photogenic. Superb climbing on the arete.</p>
<p><b>3. Stax a Time (7b)</b> hard moves on the left-hand side of the arete. Spaced BRs low down.</p>
<p><b>4. In the Stox (7a)</b> A worthwhile pitch up the centre of the side wall.</p>
<p><b>5. As Loose as This ? (6c+) &starf;</b> solid. A better route to the left. Fingery and sustained.</p>
<p><b>6. No Intent (6b+)</b> wall and vague groove/flake on left-hand side of wall.</p>
<p><b>7. Guilty (6c) </b>tricky start to easier ground above half-height ledge.</p>
<p><b>8. The Plea (6a+) &starf;</b> a fine little route with pleasant face climbing.</p>
<p><b>9. Witness This (6c+)</b> intense sequence on right-hand side of side wall. Perfect rock.</p>
<p><b>10. For the Prosecution (6c+) </b>left-hand side of wall. Poor.</p>
<p><b>11. The Fifth Amendment (6c) </b>technical start up front of pillar. Good.</p>
<p><b>12. In the Defence (7a) </b>direct line via pillar with scary last clip followed by the crux.</p>
<p><b>13. Open Verdict (7a+) &starf;</b> bouldery start with a mid-height crux. Top end of grade.</p>
<p><b>14. Community Service (6c+) &starf;</b> good, sustained line to the left. A bit hollow low down.</p>
<p><b>15. The Jury's Out (6c) &starf; </b>pillar at back right-hand corner. Boldish and technical. Good.</p>

<p><b>16. Runyonectomy (6b)</b> short poor wall left of corner.</p>
<p><b>17. Megaflapped (6c)</b> via overlap and difficult move on upper wall.</p>
<p><b>18. Overclapped (7a+) </b>tough little cookie through the overlaps.</p>
<p><b>19. Thundertrapped (7a)</b> short sharp shock via the overlap.</p>
<p><b>20. Happy, Slappy, Chappy (7a) </b>powerful sequence through overlap.</p>
<p><b>21. Overslapped (7a) &starf;</b> excellent technical face to left, no overlap! Best route on this wall.</p>
<p><b>22. Kill the Bill (7b+)</b> very technical wall to left. Needs rebolting.</p>
<p><b>23. Robert's Roberts (7a+) </b>hard sequence through bulge and short wall via undercut.</p>
<p><b>24. Watch this Space (6c)</b> short technical face on left. Worthwhile.</p>
