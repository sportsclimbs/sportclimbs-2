**1. Columnus (7b+)**  
The innocuous-looking hanging arete.

**2. Banana Republic E3 5c**  
The corner with a tricky entry and exit.

**3. The Orange Order (6c)**  
This fills the gap between *Orange Free State* and the groove.

**4. Orange Free State (6b+) *★***  
The left-hand line. Fine wall climbing to a jug-fest roof.

**5. Berried (6c)**  
The right-hand line to breach the upper roof. Intricate low down.

**6. Black Rights (7b) *★***  
A subtle technical line on the wall to the left. Hard and blind.

**7. High Society (7a+) *★★***  
The first, and easier of two classic 7a+s. Similar to *Kiss Me Hardy* but with a good rest at half-height.

**8. Kiss Me Hardy (7a+) *★★★***  
A Cheedale classic with sustained but varied climbing. Loss of holds at the start mean using a stick clip for the first bolt.

**9. Kiss My Arcy (7b) *★★***  
Requires both finger power and good technique, all the way to the upper break.

**10. Demystified (7b+)**  
A short intense pitch with very reach dependent bulge. Hard.

**11. Mouldwarp Wall (7c+)**  
Takes a line of very thin (and dirty) holds on the wall immediately to the left. First BR missing.

**12. Brothers in Arms (7b+) *★***  
The hanging scoop gained by the lower bulge. Suitable for a long-armed dwarf. Desperate.

**13. Project (open)**

**14. Rouge Total (7b)**  
More desperate moves through the lower bulge.

**15. Total Rock (7c)**  
A long-standing project with desperate moves. 

**16. Jungle Rock (7b) *★***  
Another powerful bulge into vague right-facing shallow groove.

**17. Some Things Change (7b+) *★***  
The bulge left again is harder. The immaculate, though short wall leads to bulge on left.

**18. Fatal Attraction (7a) *★★***  
Steep powerful pulls through the initial bulge lead to more of the same at the final overlap.

**19. Lucky Finger (7b) *★***  
Climbs the vague arete with sustained climbing and the crux at the top. Well worth seeking out.
