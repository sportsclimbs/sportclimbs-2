**20\. Lucky Finger (7b) ★** vague arete with sustained climbing and the crux at the top. Well worth seeking out.

**21\. Fatal Attraction (7a) ★★** initial bulge and crack/groove to overlap. Hard finish to ledge.

**22\. Some Things Change (7b+) ★** the bulge left again is harder. Immaculate, though short, wall leads to bulge on left.

**23\. Jungle Rock (7b) ★** another powerful bulge onto vague right-facing shallow groove.

**24\. Total Rock (7c)** a long-standing project with desperate moves. Not marked on topo.

**25\. Rouge Total (7b)** more desperate moves through the lower bulge.

**26\. Project (open)**

**27\. Brothers in Arms (7b+) ★** the hanging scoop gain by the lower bulge. Suitable to a long-armed dwarf. Desperate.

**28\. Mouldwarp Wall (7c+)** very thin (and dirty) holds on the wall immediately to the left. First BR missing.

**29\. Demystified (7b+)** short intense pitch with very reach dependent bulge. Hard.

**30\. Kiss My Arcy (7b) ★★** first of a fine trio. Fingery all the way to the upper break.

**31\. Kiss Me Hardy (7a+) ★★★** classic sustained fingery wall climbing just right of bush.

**32\. High Society (7a+) ★★** above bush. Similar to Kiss Me Hardy but with a good rest at half-height.

**33\. Black Rights (7b) ★** a subtle technical line on the wall to the left. Hard and blind.

**34\. Berried (6c)** the right-hand of two to breach the upper roof. Intricate low down.

**35\. Orange Free State (6b+) ★** the left-hand line. Fine wall climbing to a jug-fest roof.

**36\. The Orange Order (6c)** fills the gap between Orange Free State and the groove.

**37\. Banana Republic E3 5c** the corner with a tricky entry and exit.

**38\. Columnus (7b+**) the innocuous-looking hanging arete.
