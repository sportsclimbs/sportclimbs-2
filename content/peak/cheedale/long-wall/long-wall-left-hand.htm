            <p><b>20. Lucky Finger (7b) *</b> vague arete with sustained climbing and the crux at the top. Well worth seeking out.</p>
            <p><b>21. Fatal Attraction (7a) **</b> initial bulge and crack/groove to overlap. Hard finish to ledge.</p>
            <p><b>22. Some Things Change (7b+) *</b> the bulge left again is harder. Immaculate, though short, wall leads to bulge on left.</p>
            <p><b>23. Jungle Rock (7b) *</b> another powerful bulge onto vague right-facing shallow groove.</p>
            <p><b>24. Total Rock (7c) </b>a long-standing project with desperate moves. Not marked on topo.</p>
            <p><b>25. Rouge Total (7b) </b>more desperate moves through the lower bulge.</p>
            <p><b>26. Project (open)</b></p>
            <p><b>27. Brothers in Arms (7b+) *</b> the hanging scoop gain by the lower bulge. Suitable to a long-armed dwarf. Desperate.</p>
            <p><b>28. Mouldwarp Wall (7c+) </b>very thin (and dirty) holds on the wall immediately to the left. First BR missing.</p>
            <p><b>29. Demystified (7b+)</b> short intense pitch with very reach dependent bulge. Hard.</p>
            <p><b>30. Kiss My Arcy (7b) **</b> first of a fine trio. Fingery all the way to the upper break.</p>
            <p><b>31. Kiss Me Hardy (7a+) *** </b>classic sustained fingery wall climbing just right of bush.</p>
            <p><b>32. High Society (7a+) **</b> above bush. Similar to Kiss Me Hardy but with a good rest at half-height.</p>
            <p><b>33. Black Rights (7b) *</b> a subtle technical line on the wall to the left. Hard and blind.</p>
            <p><b>34. Berried (6c)</b> the right-hand of two to breach the upper roof. Intricate low down.</p>
            <p><b>35. Orange Free State (6b+) *</b> the left-hand line. Fine wall climbing to a jug-fest roof.</p>
            <p><b>36. The Orange Order (6c)</b> fills the gap between Orange Free State and the groove.</p>
            <p><b>37. Banana Republic E3 5c</b> the corner with a tricky entry and exit.</p>
            <p><b>38. Columnus (7b+</b>) the innocuous-looking hanging arete.</p>
