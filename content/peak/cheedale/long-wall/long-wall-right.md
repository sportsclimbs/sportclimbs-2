About 50 feet or so to the right of the first route is a smooth wall with 3BRs. This is the line of **Skid Marks (6b+)**. Possibly harder since the loss of a hold.

**1. Child's Play E4 6a** difficult to spot. Finger pockets on the left-hand side of a scoop with PR above.
{.mt0}

**2. Nookie Bear (7a)** three hard moves and 3BRs. Tinies and split fingers?

**3. Hot Panties (7a) ★** another finger-ripping test piece for the grade.

**4. Steaming Strides (7a+) ★** left-hand finish with slopers and crimps.

**5. Child Lock (7a+) ★** exits right side of alcove and ploughs straight on up. Fingery again.

**6. Multiplex E4 6b ★★** the original route of the wall and still its best. Leftwards from alcove to ledge, then slab above. **Smutt E5 6c** is the direct start.

**7. A Bout de Soufflé (7c) ★★** hard moves on tiny pockets from a break with a useful stump. Slippery above.

**8. Cathedral Taste (7b+) ★★** more of the same to the left with blind moves low down. Pleasant and open above.

**9. Breathless E6 6c ★★** desperate moves on the intricate face to the left. Hard to clip some of the gear.

**10. Meterol (7b+) ★★** superb climbing left of the faint groove line. Desperate moves on a tiny spike.

**11. Gob on the Mountain (7c) ★** just left again. Desperate moves on an ear of rock.

**Gobstopper (7c) ★** adds an independent direct finish to Gob on the Mountain.

**12. Atlantic Realm (7b+) ★★** starts under the roof. Up and then right onto the headwall.

**13. Big News Man Mouth Was 7b** but holds have come off. Unclimbable?

**Project** The overhanging wall

**14. Freeway HVS 5a** the large corner line. A classic of its type and rarely climbed.

**15. Macumba (7a+) ★** left out of Freeway and up to overlap. Hard finale.

**16. Casamance (7a+) ★** direct via scoop to join Macumba. Harder but with a good rest at half height.

**17. Trick Show (7b+) ★** desperate sequence on the lower wall leads to easier climbing to roof. Grope through to top.

**18. The Balancing Act (7b) ★** a fine route, intricate lower down and an exciting juggy finish.

**19. Rolling Stone E4 6b** just left and somewhat eliminated by The Balancing Act.

**Monopedagogue E3 5c** the long slim corner line. Excellent but very bold low down.
