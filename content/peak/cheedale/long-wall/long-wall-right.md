**1. The Balancing Act (7b) *★***  
A fine route, intricate lower down and an exciting juggy finish.

**2. Trick Show (7b+) *★***  
A desperate sequence on the lower wall leads to easier climbing to roof. Grope through to top.

**3. Casamance (7a+) *★***  
Climb direct via a scoop to join *Macumba*. Harder but with a good rest at half height.

**4. Macumba (7a+) *★***  
Go left out of *Freeway* and up to overlap. Hard finale.

**5. Freeway (HVS 5a)**  
The large corner line. A old classic that's rarely climbed nowadays.

**6. Titanic (7b+) *★★***  
The obvious very overhanging wall is gained from the left. Harder for the short.

**7. Big News Man Mouth (7b+) *★★***  
Start up *Titanic* but move right around the arete onto the face to finish up the next route.

**8. North Atlantic Drift (8a) *★★***  
Climb *Atlantic Realm* up the corner and past the roof then head up leftwards up the face.

**9. Atlantic Realm (7b+) *★★***  
Starts under the roof. Up and then right onto the headwall.

**10. Gob on the Mountain (7c) *★***  
Starts to the right of the big roof. Desperate moves on an ear of rock.

**11. Gobstopper (7c) *★***  
An independent direct finish to *Gob on the Mountain*.

**12. Meterol (7b+) *★★***  
Superb climbing left of the faint groove line. Desperate moves on a tiny spike.

**13. Breathless (7c+) *★★***  
Needs rebolting since loss of holds. Clipping the second bolt is hard and dangerous so it's best to pre-clip it with a stick at present.

**14. Cathedral Taste (7b+) *★★***  
Hard blind moves low down to gain the balancy slab above.

**15. A Bout de Soufflé (7c) *★★***  
Hard moves on tiny pockets from a break with a useful stump. Slippery above.


**16. Multiplex (E4 6b) *★★***  
The original route of the wall from the pre-sport era with good climbing. Leftwards from alcove to ledge, then slab above. The direct start is **Smutt (E5 6c)**.

**17. Child Lock (7a+) *★***  
A direct version of the previous route. Start up that *Multiplex* and exit the right side of alcove and plough straight on up.

**18. Hot Panties (7a) *★***  
A powerful start leads to a fingery finish.

**19. Steaming Strides (7a+) *★***  
Climb up *Hot Panties* heading up leftwards where that route goes right. Slopers and crimps.

**20. Nookie Bear (7a)**  
Three hard moves and 3BRs. Tiny holds and split fingers?


About 20 metres or so to the right of the last route is a short, smooth wall with 3 bolts. This is the line of **Skid Marks (6c)**. Possibly harder since the loss of a hold.
