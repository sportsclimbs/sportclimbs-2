## Approach

Undoubtedly one of Cheedale’s prize assets, Long Wall lies directly opposite the Embankment, between Runyon’s Corner and Two Tier. Head first for Two Tier and continue along the path rightwards below Two Tier Right until the crag is reached.

## History

Original development was a slow process with traditional routes by a variety of climbers active in the dale: Gabe Regan, Chris Jackson and Bob Conway and inevitably Gary Gibson. Subsequent to this Chris Wright, Martin Crocker and Dave Pegg added the occasional mixed route but it wasn’t until 1988 when its true potential was realised with the arrival of sports-climbing. Both Keith Sharples and Chris Hardy added a handful of routes which clearly pointed to the future of climbing on this crag. Inevitably in the mid Nineties Gary Gibson returned for a reassessment of the cliffs remaining potential and added a further 11 routes, as well as re-equipping others, to bring the cliff almost up-to-date. Chris Wright and Ian Dunn also weighed in with a route each around the same time.

## Character and conditions

The rock is of a very compact nature with steep leaning bulges that result in a powerful style of climbing. It doesn’t normally dry out until May but once dry tends to stay dry for the rest of the season. It stays in the shade until late afternoon making it a good place to escape the summer heat.
