            <p><b>Mix and Match (6a)</b> left-hand of two warm-ups from part way up bank</p>
            <p><b>Maximum Potential (6a)</b> left of chimney through upper overlap.</p>
            <p><b>1. Pepsi Max (6c)</b> left-hand line of wall to and through the large roof.</p>
            <p>Just to the right a traditional line leads to the roof. A step right and moves through the overlap gains the tree belay: <b>Max factor (E2 5b) *</b></p>
            <p><b>2. Max Head Room (6c+) ** </b>obvious direct line to and through roof. Excellent.</p>
            <p>A bold trad. line leads up the bald walls to the right with little protection: <b>Max wall (E5 6a **).</b> </p>
            <p><b>3. Max Pax 'em In (7a) * </b>direct from top of tiny groove. A difficult sequence</p>
            <p><b>4. Max 'is Wall (6c) **</b> short technical wall to rest and fine upper scoop.</p>
            <p><b>5. Lunatic Fringe (6c+) </b> tricky bulge and wall to easier climbing above. Joins last route.</p>
            <p><b>6. Max Pact (6b)</b> warm up route through initial bulge and finish via wall left of groove.</p>
            <p><b>7. The Max Works (6c+) **</b> a super little route trending rightwards from the ramp.</p>
            <p><b>8. Max to the Wall (7a+) *</b> direct line via fine technical and fingery moves. Low in grade.</p>
            <p><b>9. Max A Million (7b) * </b>the infamous reach route. You've either got it or you haven't.</p>
            <p><b>10. Maxonomy (7a+)</b> contrived line to right. Stay on the line of the BRs.</p>
            <p><b>11. The Max Museum (7a+) *</b> intense fingery line to right.</p>
            <p><b>12. Maxwell House (7b+) *</b> running out of route names? Hard moves and harder clip of 2nd BR!</p>
            <p><b>13. Rough Justice (7c)</b> getting even more intense and bouldery.</p>
            <p><b>14. A Bigger Max (7b+)</b> another intense boulder problem.</p>
            <p><b>15. The Max They Love to Hate (7b) *</b> a superb fingery problem starting on the stepping stones.</p>
            <p><b>16. Dream Thief (7a)</b> begins on the first stepping stone of old.</p>

            <p>To the right and across the widest part of the roofs are three excellent routes:<br /><b>Tyrannosaurus Max (E3 5c) </b>Takes a thin crackline: <b>Let the Max Increase (7b) *</b> a leftwards line along the lip<b>, Crankus Maximus (7b+) </b>is its direct finish, <b>Maximuscle (7c+) </b>swings right from 'increase' to cross the roof finishing on a tree root and <b>Maxing Around (7a+) </b>a direct assault of the flat roof.</p>
