An excellent face recently rebolted with a couple of new routes and a number of excellent sport routes: a few worthwhile traditional routes are thrown in for good measure. The face, which proves far more compact than the neighbouring Embankment, is easily reached by following the track below the Embankment down to the river and following this downstream for 100m to the obvious face.

The cliff is composed of a very compact, water-washed limestone and offers fingery routes which become a little steeper on the right-hand side of the cliff. Here a series of stepping stones lead out below a large roof which provides a trio of very impressive pitches not on the topo diagram.
