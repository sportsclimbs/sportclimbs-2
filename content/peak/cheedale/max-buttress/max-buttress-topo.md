**Mix and Match (6a)** left-hand of two warm-ups from part way up bank

**Maximum Potential (6a)** left of chimney through upper overlap.

**1\. Pepsi Max (6c)** left-hand line of wall to and through the large roof.

Just to the right a traditional line leads to the roof. A step right and moves through the overlap gains the tree belay: **Max factor (E2 5b) ★**

**2\. Max Head Room (6c+) ★★** obvious direct line to and through roof. Excellent.

A bold trad. line leads up the bald walls to the right with little protection: **Max wall (E5 6a ★★).**

**3\. Max Pax 'em In (7a) ★** direct from top of tiny groove. A difficult sequence

**4\. Max 'is Wall (6c) ★★** short technical wall to rest and fine upper scoop.

**5\. Lunatic Fringe (6c+)** tricky bulge and wall to easier climbing above. Joins last route.

**6\. Max Pact (6b)** warm up route through initial bulge and finish via wall left of groove.

**7\. The Max Works (6c+) ★★** a super little route trending rightwards from the ramp.

**8\. Max to the Wall (7a+) ★** direct line via fine technical and fingery moves. Low in grade.

**9\. Max A Million (7b) ★** the infamous reach route. You've either got it or you haven't.

**10\. Maxonomy (7a+)** contrived line to right. Stay on the line of the BRs.

**11\. The Max Museum (7a+) ★** intense fingery line to right.

**12\. Maxwell House (7b+) ★** running out of route names? Hard moves and harder clip of 2nd BR!

**13\. Rough Justice (7c)** getting even more intense and bouldery.

**14\. A Bigger Max (7b+)** another intense boulder problem.

**15\. The Max They Love to Hate (7b) ★** a superb fingery problem starting on the stepping stones.

**16\. Dream Thief (7a)** begins on the first stepping stone of old.

To the right and across the widest part of the roofs are three excellent routes:  
**Tyrannosaurus Max (E3 5c)** Takes a thin crackline: **Let the Max Increase (7b)** ★ a leftwards line along the lip, **Crankus Maximus (7b+)** is its direct finish, **Maximuscle (7c+)** swings right from **..Max Increase** to cross the roof finishing on a tree root and **Maxing Around (7a+)** a direct assault of the flat roof.
