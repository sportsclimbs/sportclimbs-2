Since it's discovery in the mid eighties the Embankment has become very popular with a number of steep and fingery routes. The crag is now 'worked-out' and there little else to do save the odd titbit or the regearing of the odd route.

## Conditions

This is one of the first of crags in the dale to dry out being in the sun for most of the day. It usually dries out in the spring after a week or so of dry weather. It tends to stay dry after that for the rest of the year, except after heavy downpours. In the summer months it can be unbearably hot and a very uncomfortable place to climb. It is a good evening venue although it popularity has waned somewhat since the regearing of Max Buttress and Two Tier Buttress.

## Rock type

Due its plentiful traffic this fragile crag has toughened up although breaking holds can still happen. The most popular routes in the Breamtime area have sadly but inevitably become polished.
