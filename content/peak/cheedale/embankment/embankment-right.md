**1. Silence of the Clams (7a+)**  
Pleasant face climbing over the fishes tail. Rebolted and holds glued up - now solid.

**2. Over the Rainbow Trout (6c+)**  
A good little route rightwards through bulge.

**3. Night of the Guppy (7b)**  
Power climbing through the bulge. Unobvious.

**4. Lamprey on Ice (7a+)**  
A roof and blunt rib. Airy at the top but easy for the grade.

**5. The Zander Welfare Club (7b) *★***  
The hanging blunt rib to the right of the hanging corner. Finish via overlap.

**6. Red Snapper Meets the Dogfish (7a+) *★***  
Climb the lower bulge and blunt arete marked by gold BRs.

**7. Name that Tuna (7c)**  
A desperate start and fingery finish.

**8. Garfish Serenade (7a+)**  
A fingery and blind pitch via the pillar to the right.

**9. The Open Secret (E4 6b) *★★***  
The fine open groove line with a short hard section, BR.

**10. Fragile Earth (E5 6a) *★***  
A fine bold pitch via a faint flake line to the right. Meager wire protection.

**11. Something Fishy (7a) *★***  
A very technical sequence after leaving the break.

**12. Fishing Without a License (7c) *★***  
Climb the obvious hanging scoop right of the ivy, or maybe now under it. Hard.

**13. Barefoot in a Pool of Sharks (7b+) *★***  
The bare-looking wall right again via an overlap and long rock over.

**14. Kissing the Mackerel (7c)**  
Desperate moves in two stages to right. Harder for the short or graded for the tall.

**15. The Life of a Stickleback (7b+)**  
A very difficult starting sequence out of the alcove.

**16. Minnows as Substitute for White Bait (6c) *★***  
Traverse the break across the wall. Finish at *Fishing Without a License*.
