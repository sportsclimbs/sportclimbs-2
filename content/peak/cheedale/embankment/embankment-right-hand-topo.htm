            <p><b>1. Silence of the Clams (7a+)</b> pleasant face climbing over the fishes tail. Rebolted and holds glued up - now solid.</p>
            <p><b>2. Over the Rainbow Trout (6c+)</b> a good little warm up rightwards through bulge.</p>
            <p><b>3. Night of the Guppy (7b)</b> power climbing through the bulge. Unobvious.</p>
            <p><b>4. Lamprey on Ice (7a+)</b> roof and blunt rib. Airy at top but easy for the grade.</p>
            <p><b>5. The Zander Welfare Club (7b) *</b> the hanging blunt rib to the right of the hanging corner. Finish via overlap.</p>
            <p><b>6. Red Snapper Meets the Dogfish (7a+) *</b> lower bulge and blunt arete marked by gold BRs.</p>
            <p><b>7. Name that Tuna (7c)</b> desperate start and fingery finish.</p>
            <p><b>8. Garfish Serenade (7a+) </b>fingering and blind pitch via pillar to the right.</p>
            <p><b>9. Open Secret (E4 6b) ** </b>the fine open groove line with a short hard section, BR.</p>
            <p><b>10. Fragile Earth E5 6a * </b>a fine bold pitch via a faint flake line to the right. Meager wire protection.</p>
            <p><b>11. Something Fishy (7a) * </b>very technical sequence after leaving the break.</p>

            <div class="topo"><img src="/img/peak/cheedale/Embankment-RH2-copy.jpg" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="267"></div>

            <p><b>12. Fishing Without a License (7c) *</b> obvious hanging scoop right of the ivy, or maybe now under it. Hard.</p>
            <p><b>13. Barefoot in a Pool of Sharks (7b+) *</b> the bare-looking wall right again via an overlap and long rock over</p>
            <p><b>14. Kissing the Mackerel (7c)</b> desperate moves in two stages to right. Harder for the short or graded for the tall.</p>
            <p><b>15. The Life of a Stickleback (7b+</b>) a very difficult starting sequence out of the alcove.</p>
            <p><b>16. Minnows as Substitute for White Bait (6c) * </b>traverse the break across the wall. Finish at Fishing Without a License.</p>
