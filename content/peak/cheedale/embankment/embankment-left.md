**1. The World According to Tommy Trout (6c+)**  
Best started up *Hungry Eyes*. Climb *Hungry Eyes* to a flake then move left around a bulge into a groove. At the top of the groove exit rightwards onto the headwall and follow this to the belay on *Hungry Eyes*.

**2. Hungry Eyes (7a+) *★***  
A short wall, powerful flake and technical headwall. There is also a left-hand variant.

**3. Beef It (7b) *★***  
A short sharp shock of moves past the BR with a sling.

**4. Superbeef (7b+) *★***  
An alternative and harder finish to *Beef It*. From the undercut on *Beef It* head up left over an overlap to the belay on *Hungry Eyes*.

**5. The Secret Gudgeon Society (7b) *★***  
Trend rightwards by series of undercuts and layaways.

**6. Stone the Loach (7c) *★***  
Takes the buttresses central line. Hard, fingery and sustained.

**7. Mind of a Turbot (7b) *★***  
The best route on this section. Intricate wall and shallow scoop.

**8. The Man Who Fell to Earth (6c+)**  
A short wall then hard and fingery moves above break.

**9. Arachnothera (6b+)**  
The open central groove with a short tricky finish.

**10. Prawnography (6c)**  
Direct and pleasant wall climbing that's low in the grade.

**11. Bream in Black (7a) *★***  
Escalating difficulties to a difficult and polished rightwards exit.

**12. Breamtime (7a+)*★***  
Also becoming polished. The centre of the wall via a high undercut flake.

**13. The Barracuda Bass Sound (7a+) *★***  
The right-hand start to the same undercut. Not polished.

**14. No Hiding Plaice (7a) *★***  
Traditional climbing via a thin crack. Now bolted.

**15. Whiting on the Wall (7c)**  
Direct from the start of *Sturgeon*. Fingery.

**16. Sturgeon in the Cupboard (7c+) *★★***  
The right-hand and best line on the wall. Sustained, fingery and harder since the loss of holds.
