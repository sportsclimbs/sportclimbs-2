            <p>A once popular venue adequately described by name. The Nook is a very small cliff with a big impact consisting of a very big roof, most suitable to those who have spent the entire winter in their cellar.</p>
            <p>The cliff has now been cleaned up and in its best state for some years with a handful of new routes and reboltings.</p>

            <p><b>1. The Dukes of Earl (Grey) 7c </b>the leftmost bolted route requires careful placement of the feet.</p>
            <p><b>2. Michael Foot Jam (7c+) ** </b>the left side of the main 'prow' roof gives the Nook's best climb. The key is in the name. </p>
            <p><b>3. A Cure for Foot Jams (7b+) ** </b>rightwards out of Foot Jam into the upper part f Arapiles</p>
            <p><b> 4. A Cure for Arapiles (7b) * </b>links leftwards out of the new 7a+.</p>
            <p><b>5. Kalymnos 8a (7a+) * </b>a new link from Arapiles into Santiano.</p>
            <p><b>6. Santiano (7a+) **</b> the original free route taking a slightly leftwards line to the lip of the prow. now rebolted</p>
            <p><B>7. A Mighty Wind (7b+) *</B> direct line through the steps left of Rock Umbrella.</p>
            <p><b>8. Rock Umbrella (7b) </b>A superb roof technicians effort. The centre of the flat roof with stacked PRs. Hold have shed and it may not now be possible.</p>
            <p><b>9. The Storm (7b+) * </b>Another renowned test-piece with 2BRs and a leap of faith from the lip to descend.</p>
            <p><b>10. A Bit of Nooky (8a) * </b>Very leaning initial wall to desperate moves to better holds and another hard move above.</p>
            <p><b>The Lockless Monster (8a) **</b>The best route of the trio with desperate moves to crux the roof.</p>
            <p><b>Theoria (8a+) * </b>A true cellar dwellers problem just left of the tree close to the crag. The start is hideous, above marginally less so.</p>
            <p><b>There's Life in the Old Log Yet (7c) * </b>the desperate wall and tiny groove just right of the tree.</p>
