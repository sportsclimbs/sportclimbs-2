## Approach

Dog's Dinner is the closest crag to the Miller's Dale end of the dale. It's located just beneath the viaduct immediately after the first tunnel (Chee Tor tunnel) and almost opposite The Cornice.

When approaching from Miller's Dale on the Monsal Trail go through the first long tunnel onto the viaduct. Go through the gap in the wall on the left and down the path and stone steps to the river. Turn sharp right heading downstream and under the viaduct. Go up right off the path just before a footbridge to reach the crag.

## Conditions

Although facing south the copious tree cover gives lots of shade. It drys quickly and there's not much seepage.

## Character

The rock is perhaps smoother than many of the Cheedale crags. The starts are typically the steepest part and the crag also has some good bouldering. There are low level two traverses of the wall, *Pedigree Chum* at 8c+ and its extension, *Finest Pedigree* at 9a+.

The climbs are described from RIGHT to LEFT.
