{.topo}

**1. Entree (8a+) ★**  
Mega intense boulder problem into slight groove.

**2. Stogumber Club (7c)**  
Similar just to left.

**3. Nerefaun E4 6c**  
The blunt hanging arete with desperate start.

**4. Stolen Fruit E4 6b ★**  
A short desperate problem left of groove. Long traverse right along break to Entree and to top.

**5. Isolate E3 6b**  
Same start as Stolen Fruit, then to roof exiting right.

**6. Malnutrition E3 6a ★**  
Short corner 5m left exiting right and up to roof. Through this finishing leftwards.

**7. Offal E3 6a ★**  
Open corner, long traverse right and over via step/flake, PR.

**8. Waffle (7b+)**  
Short technical start via rib of open corner. Desperate roof sequence.

**9. Titter Ye Not (8a) ★**  
Direct assault of the roof. Knees aloud.

**10. System Malfunction (7b) ★★**  
Super roof problem through left side of roof.

**11. Mega-Bites (7b)**  
Another fine power problem to left, before platform and above stump.

**12. Running on Empty E5 6a**  
Diagonal rightwards across wall from platform. Airy.

**13. Jackson's Browned Off (6c+)**  
Direct, not right, from platform gives good problem.

**14. Far from the Madding Crowd (7b+) ★**  
Gained from the left-hand side of upper tier.

**15. Poultry in Motion (7b+) ★**  
A few hard sharp pulls on the headwall.

**16. Evidently Chickentown (7c) ★★**  
Superb power moves into bottomless finger crack.

**17. Just Pullet (7a+) ★**  
Exposed open line to the left via flakes.

**18. Cockerel Cry (6c+) ★**  
A wall left of Jackson's and direct via bulges above.

**19. Smelting Pot (6c+) ★**  
The blunt rib left of crack and tough, wall above break.

**20. Case Adjourned (6c+) ★★**  
A fine lower wall with fingery start leads to bold open face above. Maybe E5 6a is a better grade?

**Open Gate (7a+) ★★★**  
A classic with a certain charm on the upper wall. Now less bold since rebolting.

**Pour Dill (7b+) ★★**  
A fine sequence on the upper wall. Has glued on hold. Pour mon chien.

**Short Sharp Shock (7c+) ★**  
Desperate wall. Rarely repeated.

The next series of routes begin at a higher level up and to the left.

Another bulge and face, getting easier above.

A very fingery lower bulge and easier wall above.

**Another Brick in the Wall (7b+)**  
The first line of BRs visible from left.

**Home from Home E4 6a**  
At left-hand end. Hidden under ivy and needs rebolting.

A further 50m along the path to the left of the crag are a quartet of routes for the connoisseur who has done everything.
