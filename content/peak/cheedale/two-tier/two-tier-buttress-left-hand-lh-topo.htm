            <p><b>1. Entree (8a+) *</b> mega intense boulder problem into slight groove.</p>
            <p><b>2. Stogumber Club (7c) </b>similar just to left.</p>
            <p><b>3. Nerefaun E4 6c</b> blunt hanging arete with desperate start.</p>
            <p><b>4. Stolen Fruit E4 6b * </b>short desperate problem left of groove. Long traverse right along break to Entree and to top.</p>
            <p><b>5. Isolate E3 6b </b>same start as Stolen Fruit, then to roof exiting right.</p>
            <p><b>6. Malnutrition E3 6a *</b> short corner 5m left exiting right and up to roof. Through this finishing leftwards.</p>
            <p><b>7. Offal E3 6a *</b> open corner, long traverse right and over via step/flake, PR.</p>
            <p><b>8. Waffle (7b+)</b> short technical start via rib of open corner. Desperate roof sequence.</p>
            <p><b>9. Titter Ye Not (8a) * </b>direct assault of the roof. Knees aloud.</p>
            <p><b>10. System Malfunction (7b) **</b> super roof problem through left side of roof.</p>
            <p><b>11. Mega-Bites (7b) </b>another fine power problem to left, before platform and above stump.</p>
            <p><b>12. Running on Empty E5 6a </b>diagonal rightwards across wall from platform. Airy.</p>
            <p><b>13. Jackson's Browned Off (6c+)</b> direct, not right, from platform gives good problem. </p>
            <p><b>14. Far from the Madding Crowd (7b+) * </b>gained from the left-hand side of upper tier. </p>
            <p><b>15. Poultry in Motion (7b+) * </b>a few hard sharp pulls on the headwall.</p>
            <p><b>16. Evidently Chickentown (7c) **</b> superb power moves into bottomless finger crack.</p>
            <p><b>17. Just Pullet (7a+) * </b>exposed open line to the left via flakes.</p>
            <p><b>18. Cockerel Cry (6c+) *</b> wall left of Jackson's and direct via bulges above.</p>
            <p><b>19. Smelting Pot (6c+) * </b>the blunt rib left of crack and tough, wall above break.</p>
            <p><b>20. Case Adjourned (6c+) **</b> fine lower wall with fingery start leads to bold open face above. Maybe E5 6a is better.</p>
            <p><b>Open Gate (7a+) ***</b> a classic with a certain charm on the upper wall. Now less bold since rebolting.</p>
            <p><b>Pour Dill (7b+) **</b> fine sequence on the upper wall. Has glued on hold. Pour mon chien.</p>
            <p><b>Short Sharp Shock (7c+) * </b>desperate wall. Rarely repeated.</p>
            <p><I>The next series of routes begin at a higher level up and to the left.</I></p>
            <p><b>The Incredible Pierre (7a+) *</b> bulges and face from right-hand side of terrace.</p>
            <p><b>The Burqa King (7b) *</b> bulge and smooth-looking face to left.</p>
            <p><b>The Bride and the Groom (6c+) *</b> another bulge and face, getting easier above.</p>
            <p><b>Project</b></p>
            <p><b>Osher, Osher, Osher (7a+) </b>very fingery lower bulge and easier wall above.</p>
            <p><b>Another Brick in the Wall (7b+)</b> first line of BRs visible from left.</p>
            <p><b>Home from Home E4 6a</b> at left-hand end. Hidden under ivy and needs rebolting.</p>

            <p><em>A further 50m along the path to the left of the crag are a quartet of routes for the connoisseur who has done everything.</em></p>

            <p><b>Magician's Enemy (6b) </b>takes a wall and bulge, <b>Birthday Boy (7b+) </b>a wall and desperate bulge and smooth wall, <b>Pulsar (7a)</b> * a wall and fine shallow groove and <b>War Locks (6c+)</b> a bouldery wall and bulge.</p>
