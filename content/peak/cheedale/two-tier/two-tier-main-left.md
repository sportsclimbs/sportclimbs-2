![Two Tier Main Wall left topo](/img/peak/cheedale/two-tier-main-left.jpg)

**1. To Boltly Go (7b+) *&starf;***  
Start up the groove and move right via a good hold onto the blunt arête. Climb this then over the slight bulge. Head leftwards to the bolt belay on *Hunger Strike*.  
*F.A. Mark Rankine 2021*

**2. Stogumber Club (7c) *&starf;***  
Fierce face climbing to the break. Traverse right to finish up *Entrée*.  
*F.A. Richie Patterson 1996*

**3. Entrée (8a) *&starf;***   
A font 7C boulder problem guards entry to the short groove above.  
*F.A. Chris Gore 1990*

**4. Kali Yuga (8b) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***   
Classic hard face climbing Cheedale style.  
*Rupert Davis 2003*

**5. Flow (8a+) *&starf;&starf;***  
More of the same but slightly easier. Don't use holds on *Countdown* though!  
*F.A. Rupert Davis 2003*

**6. Countdown (7b) *★★★***  
Intense fingery face climbing via a vague shallow groove.  
*F.A. Ron Fawcett 1981*

**7. Darl pitch 1 (7a) *★★***  
A super line via the obvious shallow groove.  
*F.A. Gabe Reagan 1976*

**8. Why Me? (7c) *★★***  
A popular and fingery line centred around difficult undercut.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1986*

**9. Orange Sunshine (7c+) *★★***  
A steep and desperate line up the nose of buttress.  
*F.F.A. Jerry Moffatt 1984*

**10. Lockdown (8b) *&starf;&starf;***  
Left as an open project for 3 decades this route was finally climbed in 2020 during the Covid pandemic.  
*F.A. Ben Moon 2020*

**11. Boring (7b+)**  
A poor and unpopular line that ends up too close to the next route.  
*F.A. Seb Grieve 1990*

**12. Ninth Life E6 6b *★★***  
The infamously bold shallow groove line with ground fall potential. A peg, a wire and a skyhook sort of protect it.  
*F.A. Jonny Woodward 1992*

**13. Daylight Robbery (7b) *&starf;&starf;***  
Powerful climbing up the flake gives access to the fingery upper wall. 4 bolts protect. Falling off while clipping the third would be a bad idea.  
*F.A. Chris Hardy 1989*

**14. Ra (E4 6a)**  
The obvious big flake line is an old trad route. Poor climbing but a useful landmark.  
*F.A. Jim Reading 1976*
