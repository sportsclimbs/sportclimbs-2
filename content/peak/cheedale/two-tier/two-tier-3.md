**1. Within Reach (6c)**  
A short technical face with reachy overlap. High first bolt.

**2. Machineries of Joy E1 5b,5b ★**  
The first flake on the wall followed by a traverse right. Shallow groove above gully, gained from left.

**3. Ape Index E6 6c**  
The name says it all. Desperate, reach dependent, wall above overlap, PR.

**4. Mad Dogs and Englishmen E3 5c ★★★**  
A trad classic. From Machineries, go left to flake and up and left through overlap. Finish by delicate traverse right and up.

**5. Spazz Energy (7a+) ★**  
Takes a diagonal line through undercuts with hard moves left to flake.

**6. A Touch of Class E5 6a ★**  
A hybrid but good. From base of flake go rightwards to join Mad Dogs. Finish direct via shallow groove.

**7. Spizz Energy E5 6b ★★★**  
Another old classic. Diagonal line, fixed gear, to undercut. Exit directly, hard.

**8. Lightweight (7c) ★★**  
Super-technical wall climbing leads to undercuts. Bold power moves to finish.

**9. Seven Pounds Overweight (7c+) ★**  
A climber's motto? Overlap, scoop and finish of Lightweight.

**10. Gonads (8a+) ★★**  
The centre of the overhung wall leading leftwards onto a flake line. A desperate sequence.

**11. Buster (8a+) ★**  
The evil-looking direct start.

**12. Minos (7c+) ★★**  
A desperate power start leads onto brilliant open face climbing.

**13. Aberration (7c+) ★★**  
From just above TR on Goldfinger, traverse rightwards above lip and so into Gonads.

**14. Flight of Icarus E6 6b ★★**  
Appropriately named. A bold excursion via a faint grey corner an overlap and bold wall.

**15. Goldfinger E2 6a ★**  
A technical start past a TR gains a hanging flake. Up to break, step left and up exiting right from the break.

**16. A Rooster in the Hen House (6b+)**  
A tricky start then rightwards line left of Goldfinger. Staples.

**17. The Chicken Run HVS 5a, 5a ★**  
Corner and crack, then long traverse right from belay. Old top pitch fell down!

**18. Rock Follies E1 5a, 5a**  
A poor route on the left wall of corner and finishing via thin crack in headwall - needs cleaning.
