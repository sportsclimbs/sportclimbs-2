            <p><b>1. Within Reach (6c) </b>short technical face with reachy overlap. High first bolt.</p>
            <p><b>2. Machineries of Joy E1 5b,5b &starf;</b> the first flake on the wall followed by a traverse right. Shallow groove above gully, gained from left.</p>
            <p><b>3. Ape Index E6 6c</b> the name says it all. Desperate, reach dependent, wall above overlap, PR.</p>
            <p><b>4. Mad Dogs and Englishmen E3 5c &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> classic. From Machineries, go left to flake and up and left through overlap. Finish by delicate traverse right and up.</p>
            <p><b>5. Spazz Energy (7a+) &starf;</b> diagonal line through undercuts with hard moves left to flake.</p>
            <p><b>6. A Touch of Class E5 6a &starf;</b> hybrid but good. From base of flake go rightwards to join Mad Dogs. Finish direct via shallow groove.</p>
            <p><b>7. Spizz Energy E5 6b &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> classic stuff. Diagonal line, fixed gear, to undercut. Exit directly, hard.</p>
            <p><b>8. Lightweight (7c) &starf;&starf; </b>super-technical wall climbing to undercuts. Bold power moves to finish.</p>
            <p><b>9. Seven Pounds Overweight (7c+) &starf;</b> a climber's motto? Overlap, scoop and finish of Lightweight.</p>
            <p><b>10. Gonads (8a+) &starf;&starf;</b> the centre of the overhung wall leading leftwards onto a flake line. A desperate sequence.</p>
            <p><b>11. Buster (8a+) &starf;</b> the evil-looking direct start.</p>
            <p><b>12. Minos (7c+) &starf;&starf; </b>desperate power start leads onto brilliant open face climbing.</p>
            <p><b>13. Aberration (7c+) &starf;&starf; </b>from just above TR on Goldfinger, traverse rightwards above lip and so into Gonads.</p>
            <p><b>14. Flight of Icarus E6 6b &starf;&starf;</b> appropriately named. A bold excursion via a faint grey corner an overlap and bold wall.</p>
            <p><b>15. Goldfinger E2 6a &starf;</b> a technical start past TR gains a hanging flake. Up to break, step left and up exiting right from the break.</p>
            <p><b>16. A Rooster in the Hen House (6b+)</b> tricky start then rightwards line left of Goldfinger. Staples.</p>
            <p><b>17. The Chicken Run HVS 5a, 5a &starf; </b>corner and crack, then long traverse right from belay. Old top pitch fell down!</p>
            <p><b>18. Rock Follies E1 5a, 5a</b> poor route on left wall of corner and finishing via thin crack in headwall - needs cleaning.</p>
