**6. Hardcore Junkie (8b)**  
The desperate wall to the left via a faint groove.

**10. A Vision of Loveliness (8a) *★★***  
A popular route making good use of glued on holds. Fingery and technical climbing leads to the break. The difficulties above this gain improving holds up the wall.  
*F.A. Ian Dunn 1999*

**11. A Picture of Perfection (8a) *&starf;***  
A hard start using some holds on *A Vision..* takes one up to the break. Move left and over the bulge and up the wall to the belay.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 2009*

**12. Recycled (7c) *&starf;***  
Follow *The Sea..* to the break. Pull round the bulge and climb up via pockets and a thin seam to the belay on  *A Picture of Perfection*.

*F.A. Unknown*

## Girdle traverses

There are two magnificent traverses of Two Tier Buttress with an incredible combination pitch linking them both. All three are incredible stamina problems:

**Nervous Breakdown (7b+) *★★★***

{.mt0}

**Communication Breakdown 7c+ *★★★***  
This time start by climbing Darl pitch 2 to the break and then follow this rightwards to the belay of *The Curse of the Mummy*, 15BRs.

**Total Breakdown 7c+ *★★★***
