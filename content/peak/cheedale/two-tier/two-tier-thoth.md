This wall is on the left side of Two Tier. It's easily recognizable by the open corner and huge flake line of the two pitch trad route Thoth.

![Two Tier, Open Gate area topo](/img/peak/cheedale/two-tier-thoth-wall.jpg)
{.topo}

**Another Brick in the Wall (7b+)**  
The furthest left line of bolts.

**Osher, Osher, Osher (7a+)**  
Just off the topo and starting a few metres left of *The Bride..*. A very fingery lower bulge leads to an easier wall above.

**1. The Bride and Groom  *&starf;*(6c+)**  
Another bulge and face getting easier above.

**2. The Burqa King (7b)**  
The bulge and smooth looking face

**3. The Incredible Pierre (7a+) *&starf;***  
Start from the right hand end of the ledge and climb through the bulge and face above.

**4. Short, Sharp and Sweet (8a)**  
Start from a block and climb the face above.

**5. Short Sharp Shock (7c+) *&starf;***  
A desperate wall. Rarely repeated.

**6. Pour Dill (7b+) *★★***  
A fine sequence on the upper wall. Has glued on hold. Pour mon chien.

**7. Open Gate (7a+) *★★★***  
A classic with a certain charm on the upper wall. Now less bold since rebolting.

**8. Case Adjourned (6c+) *★★***  
A fine lower wall with fingery start leads to bold open face above. Maybe E5 6a is a better grade?

**9. Smelting Pot (6c+) *★***  
The blunt rib left of the corner crack followed by a tough wall above break.

**10. Thoth (E1 5b, 5a)**  
    1. Climb the corner and move right to belay below the huge undercut flake.  
    2. Climb the flake to the lower off of *Smelting Pot*.

**11. Cockerel Cry (6c+) *★***  
The wall right of the corner of *Thoth* then direct via bulges above.

**12. Jackson's Browned Off (6c+)**  
Direct, not right, from platform gives good problem.

**13. Running on Empty E5 6a**  
A short solo rightwards across wall from platform.

The next 3 routes start from a ledge above the previous route. This can be reached by climbing *Jackson's Browned Off* until you can move right to the belay.

**14. Just Pullet (7a+) *★***  
Exposed open line to the left via flakes.

**15. Evidently Chickentown (7c) *★★***  
Superb power moves into bottomless finger crack.

**16. Poultry in Motion (7b+) *★***  
A few hard sharp pulls on the headwall.

A further 50m along the path to the left of the crag are four more routes for the connoisseur who has done everything. These can also be reached from Nettle Buttress.

A wall and fine shallow groove

A bouldery wall and bulge.
