![Two Tier Main Wall Right topo](/img/peak/cheedale/two-tier-main-right.jpg)

**14. Ra E4 6a**  
Tight V groove to left onto grassy ground.

**15. The Cruise Brothers (7a+)**  
Another short and difficult test-piece.

**16. Luck be the Magic Number (7a+)**  
Short and difficult test piece on rib..

**17. Some Coincidence (7a+) *★***  
Left side of wall on superb rock. Finish rightwards. Excellent though blind moves.

**18. Rising Sap (6c) *★***  
Hard moves left of BRs from ledge, then flakes above. It's easier if you use the start of *Osiris* at the bottom (6b+).

**19. Osiris (E1 5a)**  
The rightward trending corner with poor protection.


**20. Subterfuge (6c) *★***   
Another tricky bulge and then the left edge of the scoop.

**21. Quality Control (7a) *★★***   
Over the bulge and via the right edge of the scoop. Exit left.

**22. Nogads (7b+) *★***  
An unlikely looking start over bulge leads to an easier wall. Go leftwards or direct at 7c.




**23. Blockhead (7b) *★***  
Start below a short groove that ends in a bulge. Climb up left to gain a good flake and continue up the right wall of the groove via two glued on holds.

**24. Reasons to be Cheerful (7b+) *★***  
Technical excellence via right edge of groove.

**25. The Inbetweenies (7a+) *★***  
An intense sequence to left over slight bulge.

**26. What a Waste (6c+)**  
Desperate past the 2nd BR. Start via groove.

**27. Tippers (7a)**  
A short desperate wall leads to easy ground and a BB above.

**28. Tip Dollar (6b)**  
The short and pleasant on rib.
