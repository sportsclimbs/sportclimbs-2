![Two Tier Main Wall Right topo](/img/peak/cheedale/two-tier-main-right.jpg)

**14. Ra E4 6a**  
The prominent groove starting just left of the tree is rarely climbed and now overgrown at the start. Lower off the BB of the next route.

**15. The Cruise Brothers (7a+)**  
A short and difficult route starting behind the tree. Possibly harder since loss of holds. 3BR to a BB.

**16. Luck be the Magic Number (7a+)**  
Short and difficult route up rib.

**17. Some Coincidence (7a+) *★***  
Left side of wall on superb rock. Finish rightwards. Excellent though blind moves.

**18. Rising Sap (6c) *★***  
Hard moves left of BRs from ledge, then flakes above. It's easier if you use the start of *Osiris* at the bottom (6b+).

**19. Osiris (E1 5a)**  
The rightward trending corner with poor protection.

**20. Subterfuge (6c) *★***   
Another tricky bulge and then the left edge of the scoop.

**21. Quality Control (7a) *★★***   
Over the bulge and via the right edge of the scoop. At the top move left to the BB on Subterfuge.

**22. Nogads (7b+) *★***  
An unlikely looking steep start (harder for the short) leads to an easier section. Go leftwards to finish up *Quality Control* (7b+) or direct via a sloper at 7c. 

**23. Blockhead (7b) *★***  
Start below a short groove that ends in a bulge. Climb up leftwards to gain a good flake then move back right up the left wall of the groove via two glued on holds. 4BR to BB.

**24. Reasons to be Cheerful (7b+) *★***  
Climb the wall of the right side of groove. Gain better holds in the bulge and then head up rightwards to the BB of the next route.

**25. The Inbetweenies (7a+) *★***  
An intense sequence up the wall and through the bulge marked by staple bolts.

**26. What a Waste (6c+)**  
Desperate past the 2nd BR. Start via groove.

**27. Tippers (7a)**  
A short desperate wall leads to easy ground and a BB above.

**28. Tip Dollar (6a+)**  
The short and pleasant on rib. New belay added in 2023.
