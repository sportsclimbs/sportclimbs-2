            <p>The huge protruding buttress on the right-hand side of the track when walking down the dale from Topley Pike gives a number of classic traditional and sport pitches.</p>

            <p>At the left-hand side of the buttress is a short wall with two sport routes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Cupid Sails (6c)</b> a bulge and wall is the left-hand line</li>
                <li><b>Piccalilli Circus (6b)</b>the fingery right-hand line</li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>1. Less of Your Lip (7b+) </b>the left-hand line moving left from the grassy ledge and with hard moves round the bulge.</p>
            <p><b>2. Liposuction (7b+) </b>branches left from the start of <em>A Bit Lippy</em> to climb roof. Pre-clip 3rd BR.</p>
            <p><b>3. A Bit Lippy (7b+) </b>Easier wall to boulder overhang Pre-clip 3rd BR.</p>
            <p><b>4. A Bit on the Side (6c) &starf; </b>branches left from the start to a pleasant open wall. A new direct start has been added.</p>
            <p><b>5. My Secret Life (7a) &starf; </b>juggy bulges and a hard move from the top break.</p>
            <p><b>6. The Wilderness Years (7b+) &starf;</b> long line up the left-hand side of the rounded arete with very definite crux.</p>
            <p><b>7. Scratch Race (7a) &starf; </b>directly up the arete with short hard section and technical interest above.</p>
            <p><b>8. The Massive (6b+) &starf; </b>takes the right-hand side of the arete with tricky moves and good rest.</p>
            <p><b>9. Stalk VS 4c &starf;&starf; </b>the large corner gained via its right-hand wall.</p>
            <p><b>10. Sparta in His Eyes (E1 5b)</b></p>
            <p><b>11. Giants (6c) &starf;&starf; </b>big long route with superb varied climbing: technical lower bulge and juggy upper overhangs. A little friable on overlaps but cleaning up. (<a href="../../../img/peak/cheedale/Giants-2.jpg" title="photo of Giants on Plum Buttress">photo</a>)</p>
            <p><b>12. Gigantic (6c+) &starf;&starf;</b> an exciting righthand extension to Giants.</p>
            <p><b>13. Mrs Brown (7c) &starf; </b>long sport route with defined difficulties through the roofs</p>
            <p><b>14. Raisin Roof (E4 6a)</b></p>
            <p><b>15. Big Plum E6 6c &starf;&starf; </b>central line with mean moves through large overhang.</p>
            <p><b>Damson in Distress (7c) &starf;&starf;</b> takes Mrs Brown to the roof then swings up and R into Big Plum and climbs it's crux. Move up and then traverse right into The Spider. Finish up this. Very exposed.</p>
            <p><b>16. The Spider (8a) &starf;&starf;&starf; </b>the central roofs. Impressive.</p>
            <p><b>A Chip off the Old Block (7c+) &starf;</b> take Sloe Gin until over the first roof then make hard moves up and left to join The Spider. Finish up this.</p>
            <p><b>18. Sloe Gin (7c) &starf;&starf; </b>now climbed in one pitch to a lower off on Sirplum. <b>17</b> The original LH finish is seldom climbed.</p>
            <p><b>19. Sirplum HVS 4c, 5b &starf;&starf;&starf; </b>the original classic wandering up the face with the hardest moves from the mid-height belay. </p>
