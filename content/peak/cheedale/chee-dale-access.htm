            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p><img src="/img/peak/cheedale/chee3.gif" width="545" height="802">The dale is very easily accessible by car but parking for the dale is a little more tricky. </p>
                
            <p>If approaching from the north, take the A6 out of Buxton for 3 miles and locate a pay and display car park at the foot of a long inclined hill: the lower Topley Pike car par.</p>
            
            <p>Alternatively at the top of this hill lies the free Topley Pike upper car park. Both of these parking places allow access to the old railway track, The Monsal Trail, running into the valley. This tracks runs directly out of the lower Topley car park. From the upper east end of the upper car park gate in the wall leads to good path down to the Monsal Trail. Turn right on this for the Cheedale crags.</p>

            <p> From the east there are two methods: </p>

            <p>From the bottom of a long hill on the B6049 pass through the hamlet of Millers Dale. After 500m turn sharp right on a small road signposted for Wormhill. Follow this steeply for 100m to a pay and display car park in an old station on the left. This can be reached from the A6 side, this time turning left for Wormhill. From the far (west) end of the car park take the Monsal Trail and follow it until it enters a tunnel. At the exit from the tunnel a gap in the wall on the left leads to a path down to the river and the crags. </p>

            <p>An alternative option, less popular now, is to continue up the Wormhill road for 1 mile until a small cottage is seen on the left, the first building on the left, in the tiny hamlet of Wormhill: careful parking nearby. Descend a small track past the cottage and follow a small right-hand branch into the dale at a small footbridge. The first buttress, Rhubarb Buttress, lies 200 yards beyond this. </p>

            <h3>Access Note:</h3> 
            
            <p>Cheedale is a nature reserve subject to the strongest forms of envrionmental protection. There is no access by negotiated concession to all the right bank and much of the left bank. For detailed current access arrangements, please check the BMC 's Regional Access database.</p>
