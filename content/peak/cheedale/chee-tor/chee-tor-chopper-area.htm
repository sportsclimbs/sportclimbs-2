            <p><b>1. Match of the Day E2 5c * </b>a fingery pitch up the centre of the rounded buttress. Climb the wall moving slightly rightwards to gain a short flake. Climb this with difficulty, then continue more easily via a larger flake to the terrace.</p>
            <p><b>2. Goal of the Month E2 5c * </b>another fingery pitch straight up the wall 3m to the right past two thread runners and a series of tricky moves.</p>
            <p><b>3. The Chopper VS 5a * </b>one of the original routes of the face. Climb the thin polished crack left of the prominent flake groove with a few hard moves to exit the crack proper. Step and climb the easier flake system to the girdle break.</p>
            <p><b>4. Sleepwalkers HVS 5a </b>this route takes the flakey, left-facing groove immediately right of the Chopper directly to the break. Becoming vegetated.</p>
            <p><b>5. Pleasant Dreams HVS 5b </b>from 5m up Sleepwalkers, move right above the lower overlap, PR, and up onto the face - tricky. Finish via the shallow groove above.</p>
            <p><b>6. Rape E2 5b * </b>a super little route on very compact rock. Move leftwards across the lower wall to reach a thin, slightly rightwards trending crack. Follow this via a tricky bulge to easier ground. This leads to the break.</p>
            <p><b>7.Grapple and Grope E5 6a </b>moves left from 5m up Gulle Gulle Groove to climb the bold wall and shallow groove above.</p>
            <p><b>8. Gulle Gulle Groove VS 4c * </b>enjoyable climbing up the clean shallow groove to the right.</p>
            <p><b>9. Flycatcher E1 5b * </b>From 5m right again, climb the wall behind the prominent tree to reach a flake, then move slightly left and up to the base of a wall/nose. Now climb rightwards to finish via a crack to gain the rake.</p>
            <p><b>10. Snap Dragon E5 6b *</b>a tough little cookie, with difficult to place protection. An excellent test-piece. From the flake on Flycatcher, move and slightly left to a thread runner. Continue slightly left up the wall above with a series of 'slaps' to gain holds a long way above.</p>
            <p><b>11. Leering Wall HVS 5b ** </b>a fine little route. Climb up to the prominent overlap to the right and make a series of difficult moves rightwards through it to gain a standing position on a good hold. Finish more easily via the open scoop above.</p>
            <p><b>12. Dagenham Dave E1 5b </b>again worthwhile. Climb the wall 5m to the right, just left of an easier line of holds, and cross a slight bulge leftwards to a ledge. Step left again and climb a shallow groove to gain the girdle break.</p>
            <p><b>13. Clive's Route VS 4c </b>the easier line of holds just to the right finishing slightly rightwards via a scoop to reach trees.</p>
            <p><b>14. Switch E2 6a </b>the wall just right past a faded thread runner.</p>
            <p><b>15. Changeling E4 6a </b>a short difficult route to the right via a slight depression. The finish slightly to the right is vegetated.</p>
            <p><b>16. Doggone Groove VS 4b </b>the obvious flaky groove at the right-hand side of the crag. Most used as access to the girdle.</p>
            <p><b>17. What Aches E3 5c </b>bold climbing via the vague rib 3m to the right of Doggone Groove. </p>
