            <h3>Left-hand Walls</h3>

            <p>Chock block full of lower grade extremes mixed with the odd E5 and sport route, these are the first wall seen when approaching from downstream and are immediately accessible. Vertical walls with the occasional overlap, all mostly fingery pitches.</p>
            <h3>Mortlock's Area</h3>

            <p>Perhaps the showpiece area of the crag with some of the Peak District's milestone extreme's. Home to such classics as Mortlock's Arete, Apocalypse, Golden Mile and Tequila Mockingbird. Fingery and demanding routes throughout.</p>
            <h3>Central Area</h3>

            <p>The bid attraction for the mid extreme climbing, these white walls offer a raft of E3's and E4's. Superb and fingery face climbing with the odd super feature added in like Ceramic.</p>

            <h3>Queer Street Area</h3>

            <p>Another area with some harder classic extreme's again all featuring fingery climbing and the occasional excellent feature. Some are becoming a tad. Polished like Queer Street but there are plenty to go for.</p>

            <h3>Chopper Area: </h3>

            <p>The fringe section of the crag with the occasional good route and plenty of easier grade pitches, one or two at VS and HVS. </p>
