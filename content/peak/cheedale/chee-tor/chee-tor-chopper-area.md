**1. Match of the Day E2 5c *★***  
A fingery pitch up the centre of the rounded buttress. Climb the wall moving slightly rightwards to gain a short flake. Climb this with difficulty, then continue more easily via a larger flake to the terrace.

**2. Goal of the Month E2 5c *★***  
Another fingery pitch straight up the wall 3m to the right past two thread runners and a series of tricky moves.

**3. The Chopper VS 5a *★***  
One of the original routes of the face. Climb the thin polished crack left of the prominent flake groove with a few hard moves to exit the crack proper. Step and climb the easier flake system to the girdle break.

**4. Sleepwalkers HVS 5a**  
This route takes the flakey, left-facing groove immediately right of the Chopper directly to the break. Becoming vegetated.

**5. Pleasant Dreams HVS 5b**  
From 5m up Sleepwalkers, move right above the lower overlap, PR, and up onto the face - tricky. Finish via the shallow groove above.

**6. Rape E2 5b *★***  
A super little route on very compact rock. Move leftwards across the lower wall to reach a thin, slightly rightwards trending crack. Follow this via a tricky bulge to easier ground. This leads to the break.

**7.Grapple and Grope E5 6a**  
Moves left from 5m up Gulle Gulle Groove to climb the bold wall and shallow groove above.

**8. Gulle Gulle Groove VS 4c *★***  
Enjoyable climbing up the clean shallow groove to the right.

**9. Flycatcher E1 5b *★***  
From 5m right again, climb the wall behind the prominent tree to reach a flake, then move slightly left and up to the base of a wall/nose. Now climb rightwards to finish via a crack to gain the rake.

**10. Snap Dragon E5 6b *★***  
A tough little cookie, with difficult to place protection. An excellent test-piece. From the flake on Flycatcher, move and slightly left to a thread runner. Continue slightly left up the wall above with a series of 'slaps' to gain holds a long way above.

**11. Leering Wall HVS 5b *★★***  
A fine little route. Climb up to the prominent overlap to the right and make a series of difficult moves rightwards through it to gain a standing position on a good hold. Finish more easily via the open scoop above.

**12. Dagenham Dave E1 5b**  
Again worthwhile. Climb the wall 5m to the right, just left of an easier line of holds, and cross a slight bulge leftwards to a ledge. Step left again and climb a shallow groove to gain the girdle break.

**13. Clive's Route VS 4c**  
The easier line of holds just to the right finishing slightly rightwards via a scoop to reach trees.

**14. Switch E2 6a**  
The wall just right past a faded thread runner.

**15. Changeling E4 6a**  
A short difficult route to the right via a slight depression. The finish slightly to the right is vegetated.

**16. Doggone Groove VS 4b**  
The obvious flaky groove at the right-hand side of the crag. Most used as access to the girdle.

**17. What Aches E3 5c**  
Bold climbing via the vague rib 3m to the right of Doggone Groove.
