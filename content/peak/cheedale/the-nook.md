The Nook is a small cliff with a big impact consisting of a huge roof with short and powerful routes.

Although dry in the rain the cliff tends to seep fairly quickly and it needs a dry spell before it's fully dry.

{.topo}

**1. The Dukes of Earl (Grey) 7c**  
The leftmost bolted route requires careful placement of the feet and possibly a big reach.  
*F.A. Keith Sharlples 1994*

**2. Michael Foot Jam (7c+) *★★***  
The left side of the main 'prow' roof gives the Nook's best climb. The key is in the name.  
*F.A. Chris Plant 1989*

**3. A Cure for Foot Jams (7b+) *★***  
Rightwards out of Foot Jam into the upper part of Arapiles.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 2014*

**4. A Cure for Arapiles (7b) *★***  
Links leftwards out of *Kalymnos*.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1985*

**5. Kalymnos 8a (7a+) *★***  
A link from *Arapiles* into *Santiano*.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 2014*


**6. Santiano (7a+) *★★***  
The original free route taking a slightly leftwards line to the lip of the prow. A Peak classic with big moves on big holds.  
*F.A. Tom Proctor 1979*

**7. A Mighty Wind (7b+) *★***  
Takes direct line through the steps left of *The Storm*.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 2014*

**8. The Storm (7b+) *★***  
Another renowned test-piece with 2BRs. The finish is on the jug *above* the anchor.  
*F.A. Jerry Moffatt 1982*

To the right of *The Storm* are some bolts from an abandoned project. Then right again is:

**A Bit of Nooky (8a+) *★***  
Climb the very leaning initial wall to desperate moves to gain better holds. Another hard move awaits above.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1989*

**The Lockless Monster (7c+) *★★***  
The best route of the harder routes on this side with desperate moves to cross the roof. Low in the grade.  
*F.A. John Hart 1989*

**Theoria (8a+) *★***  
A true cellar dwellers problem just left of the tree close to the crag. The start is hideous, above marginally less so.  
*F.A. John Hart 1989*

**There's Life in the Old Log Yet (7c) *★***  
The desperate wall and tiny groove starting just right of the tree.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1993*
