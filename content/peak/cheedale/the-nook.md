The Nook is a small cliff with a big impact consisting of a huge roof with short and powerful routes.

Although dry in the rain the cliff tends to seep fairly quickly and it needs a dry spell before it's fully dry.

**1. The Dukes of Earl (Grey) 7c**  
The leftmost bolted route requires careful placement of the feet.

**2. Michael Foot Jam (7c+) ★★**  
The left side of the main 'prow' roof gives the Nook's best climb. The key is in the name.

**3. A Cure for Foot Jams (7b+) ★★**  
Rightwards out of Foot Jam into the upper part f Arapiles

**4. A Cure for Arapiles (7b) ★**  
Links leftwards out of the new 7a+.

**5. Kalymnos 8a (7a+) ★**  
A new link from Arapiles into Santiano.

**6. Santiano (7a+) ★★**  
The original free route taking a slightly leftwards line to the lip of the prow.

**7. A Mighty Wind (7b+) ★**  
Takes direct line through the steps left of *Rock Umbrella*.

**8. Rock Umbrella (7b??)**  
An old route that is something of a mystery now. It's shed some holds over the years and needs reequipping. It may be harder or even impossible now. Takes the centre of the flat roof with stacked PRs.

**9. The Storm (7b+) ★**  
Another renowned test-piece with 2BRs and a leap of faith from the lip to descend.

**10. A Bit of Nooky (8a) ★**  
Very leaning initial wall to desperate moves to better holds and another hard move above.

**The Lockless Monster (7c+) ★★**  
The best route of the trio with desperate moves to crux the roof.

**Theoria (8a+) ★**  
A true cellar dwellers problem just left of the tree close to the crag. The start is hideous, above marginally less so.

**There's Life in the Old Log Yet (7c) ★**  
the desperate wall and tiny groove just right of the tree.
