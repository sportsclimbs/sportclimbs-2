            <h3>Character</h3>

            <p>Undoubtedly the best crag in the dale and one the Peak's best sport climbing venues. Superb vertical walls in the centre of the crag are mixed with overlaps and shallow grooves give way to impressive overhanging walls and roofs on the wings to give a cliff popular with harder climbers. Almost every climb is now fully bolted.</p>

            <h3>Conditions</h3>

            <p>The Cornice is renowned for its seepage problems but generally begins to dry out mid May to early June. Most of the routes on the wings of the crag don&#146;t dry out until July but once dry the crag generally remains dry well into the Autumn and can be climbed on even in rainy weather. </p>

            <p>This sunless venue along with it's closeness to the river make it ideal spot to escape the ferocity of summer heat waves.</p>
