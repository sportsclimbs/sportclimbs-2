            <h3>Character</h3>

            <p>Undoubtedly the best crag in the dale and probably in the Peak for Sports climbing. Superb vertical walls in the centre of the crag mixed with overlaps and shallow grooves give way to impressive overhanging walls and roofs on the wings to give a cliff purely for the hard man. The climbing here is most predominantly bolted save for the odd traditional route which has fallen into disrepair due to lack of interest.</p>

            <h3>Conditions</h3>

            <p>The Cornice is renowned for its seepage problems but generally begins to dry out mid May to early June. Most of the routes on the wings of the crag don&#146;t dry out until July but once dry the crag generally remains dry into the Autumn and can be climbed on even in rainy weather. </p>
