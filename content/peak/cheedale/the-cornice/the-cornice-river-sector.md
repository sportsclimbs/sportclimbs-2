**1. That Was the River (7b+) &starf;&starf;**  
A superb pumpy rightwards line slowly easing.

**2. Streamline (7c+) &starf;**  
An eliminate with desperate start.

**3. This is the Sea (7c+) &starf;**  
Another series of desperate moves onto a shallow edge.

**4. Old Man River (7b) &starf;&starf;**  
Superb route with fingery moves and exiting leftwards. The obvious continuation finish is **Keep on Rollin' (7b+)**.

**Dirty Old Man (7c) &starf;&starf;**  
Links the start of Old Man River with the next route.

**5. The Naive and Sentimental Lover (7b+) &starf;&starf;**  
Climbs up over the small roof to gain a hole then move out L and up the wall above. A fine but fingery wall climb.

**6. Up the River Without a Paddle (7a) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
Follows Naive and Sentimental to the hole then move R and follow the bolts and holds rightwards. Magnificent climbing when dry.

**7. Snails of the Riverbank (7b) &starf;&starf;**  
Another fine climb with two hard overlaps and a fingery wall.

**8. The Spiders from Mars (6b+)**  
An old route now cleaned, bolted and free climbed.

**9. The Monday Club (7a)**  
The two overlaps and a fine clean headwall.

**10. Trampled Underfoot (6c+) &starf;**  
Better right-hand variant finishing via thin crack.

**11. Gardener's Question Time (7a)**  
Hard wall to overlap, then easier.

**12. Rue Morgue E3 5c &starf;**  
Defunct traditional route first climbed in 1979 by Chris Jackson. Now superseded by various sport routes.

**13. After the Goldfish (7b) &starf;**  
Desperate moves and a long reach through the overlap.

**14. Crowd Control (7c) &starf;**  
Steady to roof, then a sea of roundedness above.

**15. Une Crime Passionnel (6c+) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
One of the best of the grade in the Peak. Easy climbing up to the first bolt then continue via a smooth looking wall which leads to the left-facing groove and crack on the upper half. 

**Blurred Lines (7c) &starf;**
Just R of Crime Passionel is a vague groove. Follow this to and over the roof to flat jugs. Move 1m L, mantle up and head leftwards to the final bolt of *Une Crime Passionel*.

**Blurred Lines RH (7b) &starf;&starf;**  
Follow Blurred Lines to the flat jugs above the roof then pull straight up via a small undercut to a double bolt belay above.

**16. Fey (6b+) &starf;&starf;**  
Climbs up via an niche down low up into the R facing groove at the top. An old neglected trad route, retro-bolted in 2021.

**17. War Memorial (6c) &starf;**  
Climbs the wall right of of Fey and gains the same finishing groove from the right. 

**18. Succubus (7b) &starf;&starf;**  
Takes the wall R of War Memorial up to and through the bulge to gain the arete above. A long sling is often used on the first bolt above the bulge to make clipping easier. Tough.

**19. Shazam E4 6a &starf;**  
Climbs the obvious thin crack, bulge and and hanging groove. The last trad routes on The Cornice?

**20. Martial Music (7a+) &starf;&starf;**  
Climbs the wall R of Shazam to below the roof. Move right before pulling over and up to the belay. 

**21. Clarion Call (7a) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
A vision of the future and a key moment in the development of UK sport climbing this was one of the very first sport routes. Climbed in 1983 and using an outrageous 5 bolts the provocatively named route caused uproar amongst the British trad fraternity at the time. A year later the route was climbed bolt free at E6. Slowly the bolts were all replaced whilst The Cornice was transformed into one of the most important sport climbing venues in the country. The Clarion Call has now been well and truly answered.
