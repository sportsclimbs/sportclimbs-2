**1. Cry of Despair (7c) *&starf;&starf;***  
Bouldery climbing through bulges. Easier with a carefully placed knee pad.  
*F.A. Chris Hardy 1990*

**2. That Was the River (7b+) *&starf;&starf;***  
A superb pumpy climbing following the rightwards line of undercut flakes.  
*F.A. Chris Hamper 1988*

**3. Rapid City (8a) *&starf;***  
Continue straight up above the start of *That was the River*.

**4. Streamline (7c+ ?)**  
This route has shed holds and not been reclimbed for years. Is it even still climbable and if so at what grade?  
*F.A. Mike Lea 1994*

**Tributary (8a+)**  
A link up climbing *This is the Sea* to the second bolt before launching out leftwards up across *That was the River* into the finish of *Rapid City*.  
*F.A. Hayden Jones 2016*

**5. This is the Sea (7c+) *&starf;***  
A short route with powerful moves on good rock.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1988*

**6. Keep on Rollin' (7b+) *&starf;&starf;***  
Thuggy climbing up good steep undercuts leads to technical wall climbing above. This is the logical extension to the next route.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1988*

**7. Old Man River (7b) *&starf;***  
The original route provides a slightly easier finish by exiting leftwards into the groove.    
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1986.*

**Dirty Old Man (7c+) *&starf;&starf;***  
Links the start of Old Man River into the finish of *The Naive and Sentimental Lover*.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 2010*

**8. Project (??)**  
A hard start into *Naive and Sentimental*.

**9. The Naive and Sentimental Lover (7c) *&starf;&starf;***  
Climbs up over the small roof to gain a hole then move out L and up the wall above. A fine but fingery wall climb and now harder since hold loss.  
*Mark Pretty 1986*

**10. Up the River Without a Paddle (7a) *&starf;&starf;***  
Follows *Naive and Sentimental* to the hole then move R and follow the undercut flake line up and rightwards. Great climbing.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1984*

{.topo}

**11. Snails of the Riverbank (7b) *&starf;&starf;***  
Another fine climb with two hard overlaps and a fingery wall.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1986. Dt start added by Ian Dunn in 1997*

**12. The Spiders from Mars (6b+) *&starf;***  
An old route now cleaned, bolted and free climbed.  
*F.A. Neil Molnar 1983*

**13. The Monday Club (7a)**  
The two overlaps and a fine clean headwall.  
*F.A. Chris Hardy 1989*

**14. Trampled Underfoot (6c+) *&starf;***  
Better right-hand variant finishing via thin crack.  
*F.A. Chris Hardy 1989*

**15. Gardener's Question Time (7a)**  
Hard wall to overlap, then easier.  
*F.A. Seb Grieve 1994*

**16. After the Goldfish (7b) *&starf;***  
Desperate moves and a long reach through the overlap.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1986*

**Crowd Control (7c) *&starf;***  
This route is parallel to and just to the right of *After the Goldfish*. Climb up to then over the small roof to a sea of roundedness above. Join the previous route a few metres below the bolt belay and finish as for that route. You can avoid the roof by starting up *Une Crime Passionel* instead at 7a+.  
*F.A. Keith Sharples 1989*
