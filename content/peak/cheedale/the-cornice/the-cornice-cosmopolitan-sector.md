These routes start where the main tourist track branches off down to the river.

**1. Unleashing the Wild Physique (8a)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
A brilliant technical exercise taking a sweeping line up and leftwards. Small holds, crimp, crimp.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1986*

**2. Cosmopolitan (7b+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
An old classic with fine climbing and a bold exit.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1985*

**3. Cordless Madness (7c)** &starf;&starf;  
The hideously thin direct finish to Cosmopolitan.  
*F.A. Nigel Slater 1989*

**4. Mandy (7b+)** &starf;
A powerful series of moves to a jug and easing above.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1986*

**5. Flowers in the Dirt (7b)** &starf;  
Direct fingery line, bold in its central section and possibly a good bit harder since loss of holds.  
*F.A. Keith Sharples 1989*

**6. The Third Order (7b)** &starf;  
Desperate moves to exit the niche. Fine above.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1985*

**7. Loco (7b+) &starf;**  
A hard boulder problem route through the bulge. even harder and reach dependent to the right.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 2002*

**8. To Pumpy for Grumpy (7b+)**  
Another powerful boulder problem. Bolted on ring hangers mark the line.  
*F.A. Nigel Slater 1989*

**9. Further Adventures in Greendale (6c/7a) &starf;**  
A steep start L of the obvious R facing corner. At the top you can either climb direct as the original route did (7a), or avoid the difficulties with a minor detour out left (6c).
*F.A. Keith Sharples 1989*

**Old Man's Adventures (7a) &starf;**  
Climb the obvious corner just R of <em>Further Adventures...</em> At the top go straight up as for the direct version of *Further Adventures...*.

**Gamman (6a+) &starf;**  
The easiest route on the crag. Climb the corner as for <em>Old Man's Adventures</em> but at the top move left on undercuts into *The Corniceman* and finish up that.  
*F.A. Jammie Sparks?? 2020*

**10. The Cruel Sea E5 6a**  
Another big sweeping line leftwards and finally up. Good. Different.

**11. The Corniceman (7a+) &starf;&starf;**  
Fine and varied climbing with a powerful start and technical higher up.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1986*
