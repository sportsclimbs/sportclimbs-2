{.topo}


**1. Big Zipper (7a+)** ★★
Line to right. Fingery rightwards exit through bulge.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1986*

**2. Beelzebub (7b+)**  
The direct finish to *Bored of the Lies* consists of a short powerful boulder problem.  
*F.A. Seb Grieve 1996*

**3. Bored of the Lies (7b+)** ★★  
An excellent wall pitch. Now usually finished up *Big Zipper* though the original and harder finish traversed right at lower level before going up.  
*F.A. Mark Pretty 1986*

**4. Ouijaboard (8a)** ★★  
Harder and more fingery wall to right. Harder the higher you get.  
*F.A. Dave Cross 1987*

**5. Four Door Dostoyevsky (8a+)** ★★  
Climbs the shallow curving groove with desperate technicalities above break. Sharp.  
*F.A. Sean Myles 1989*

**6. Powerplant (8a)** ★★★  
The classic of its grade in the Dale. The difficulties are centred around the overlap which is easier with kneepads. **Powerpant (8a)** connects *Powerplant* with *Devonshire Arms* from just the first crux on the former.  
*F.A. Chris Plant 1988*

**7.  Devonshire Arms (8a+)** ★★★  
The even more powerful wall to the right. Crimps, pinches provide the sequence.  
*F.A. Craig Devonshire 1997*

**8.  K3 (8a+)** ★★★  
Undercutting nightmare leftwards through bulge and finally up.  
*F.A. Seb Grieve 1994*

**K5 (8b)**  
Start up K3 but when you get to the ‘pancake’ undercuts step left into Devonshire Arms then left again into Powerplant above the crux, finish up this.  
*F.A. Kristian Clemmow 2011*

**K2 (8b+)**  
Extends K5 from Poweplant across Fourdoor to the belay of Bored.  
*F.A. Steve McClure 2011*

**9. 42 (8b+)** ★★★  
A more direct line than K3 after flat flake. Hardest route hereabouts.  
*F.A. John Hart 1995*

**10. 32 (8b+)** ★★  
The bulges to the right to join R’n’P.  
*F.A. Kristian Clemmow 2007*

**The Anatomy Act (8b+)** ★★  
Climb 32 to it’s junction with R’n’P then climb straight up the wall to join and finish up Snatch.  
*F.A. Alex Barrows 2018*

**11. R’n’P (8a+)** ★★★  
Mean. More undercuts to the right gain the upper wall at a scoop. Easier above?  
*F.A. John Hart 1990*

**12. Snatch (8b)** ★★★   
Starts up *R'n'P* but breaks out right above the bulge.  
*F.A. Kristian Clemmow 2003*

**13. Barney Ragin’ (8b+)** ★★
Starts up R’n’P but goes R through the bulge via a slot and continues up to join and finish up Love Amongst the Butterflies  
*F.A. James McHaffie 2010*
