![The Cornice Clarion Call topo](/img/peak/cheedale/corncct.gif)
{.topo}

**1. Clarion Call (6c+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
Classic and perhaps the UK's first sport route. Technical start and sustained above.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1983*

**The Poppy Fields (7b+)**  
A suprisingly good eliminate squeezed onto the rock between the two classics.  
*F.A. Simon Lee 2004*

**2. Armistice Day (7a) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
Sustained throughout with crux through obvious overlap.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1984*

**3. Who's Line is it Anyway (7a+) &starf;&starf;**  
Another fine sustained pitch with hard moves direct at 2nd BR and 4th.  
*F.A. Jon de Montjoye 1989*

**4. Big Store E5 6b &starf;&starf;** trad. climbing via arched groove and span left  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1984*

**5. The Egyptian Bizarre E5 6b** direct finish to Big Store, 2BRs.  
*F.A. Jon de Montjoye 1989*

**6. Big Zipper (7a+) &starf;**  
Line to right. Fingery rightwards exit through bulge.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1986*

**7. Bored of the Lies (7b+)** &starf;&starf;  
An excellent wall pitch. Technical and sustained with crux right and up at top.  
*Mark Pretty 1986*

**8. Ouijaboard (8a)** &starf;&starf;  
Harder and more fingery wall to right. Harder the higher you get.  
*F.A. Dave Cross 1987*

**9. Four Door Dostoyevsky (8a+) &starf;&starf;** shallow curving groove with desperate technicalities above break. Sharp.  
*F.A. Sean Myles 1989*

**10. Powerplant (8a)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
The classic of its grade in the Dale. The difficulties are centred around the overlap. **Powerpant (8a)** connects *Powerplant* with *Devonshire Arms* from just the first crux on the former.  
*F.A. Chris Plant 1988*

**11. Devonshire Arms (8a+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
The even more powerful wall to the right. Crimps, pinches provide the sequence.  
*F.A. Craig Devonshire 1997*

**12. K3 (8a+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
Undercutting nightmare leftwards through bulge and finally up.  
*F.A. Seb Grieve 1994*

**12a K5 (8b)**  
Start up *K3* but when you get to the 'pancake' undercuts step left into *Devonshire Arms* then left again into *Powerplant* above the crux, finish up this.  
*Kristian Clemmow 2011*

**12b K2 (8c)**  
Continues from *Poweplant* across *Fourdoor* to the belay of Bored.  
*F.A. Steve McClure 2011*

**13. 42 (8b+) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
A more direct line than *K3* after flat flake. Hardest route hereabouts.  
*John Hart 1995*

**13a 32 (8b+)** &starf;&starf;  
The bulges to the right to join *R'n'P*.  
*F.A. Kristian Clemmow 2007*

**13b The Anatomy Act (8b+)** &starf;&starf;
Climb *32* to it's junction with *R'n'P* then climb straight up the wall to join and finish up *Snatch*.  
*F.A. Alex Barrows 2018*

**14. R'n'P (8a+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
Mean. More undercuts to the right gain the upper wall at a scoop. Easier above?  
*F.A. John Hart 1990*

**Barney Ragin' (8b+) &starf;&starf;**  
Starts up *R'n'P* but goes R through the bulge via a slot and continues up to join and finish up *Love Amongst the Butterflies* Links the start of *R'n'P* with *Love Amongst the Butterflies*.  
*James McHaffie 2010*

**15. Love Amongst the Butterflies (8b)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
The antithesis of all to the left. Technicalities in the extreme. Keep crimping.  
*Seb Grieve 1996*

**16. Asia Shadow Player (8b)** &starf;&starf;  
A direct finish to *Butterflies*. Hideous.  
*Steve McClure 1997*

**Somehow Super (8c)** &starf;&starf;  
Starts as for *Love Amongst the Butterflies* but go straight up.  
*Steve McClure 1997*
