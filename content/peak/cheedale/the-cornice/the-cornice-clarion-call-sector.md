{.topo}

The first few routes are just off of the topo but easily located. On the upper part of the crag is a huge shield of rock bounded by two crack lines. The lefthand one goes up leftwards and is taken by *Une Crime Passionnel*. The righthand one goes rightwards and is taken by by *Fey* and *War Memorial*. The *Blurred Lines* routes climb the wall and bulge between these two.

**Une Crime Passionnel (6c+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
One of the best of the grade in the Peak. This is just a few metres left of *War Memorial*. It climbs the smooth wall to the obvious left-facing groove line through the bulge above. Originally climbed as a 'trad' route with a naughty drilled golo for protection.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1982*

**Blurred Lines (7c) *&starf;***
Just R of Crime Passionel is a vague groove. Follow this to and over the roof to flat jugs. Move 1m L, mantle up and head leftwards to the final bolt of *Une Crime Passionel*.  
*Jamie Sparkes 2021*

**Blurred Lines RH (7b?) *&starf;&starf;***  
Follow Blurred Lines to the flat jugs above the roof then pull straight up via a small undercut to a double bolt belay above. Now harder since loss of holds.  
*Jamie Sparkes 2021*

**Fey (6b+) *&starf;***  
Climbs the wall just left of *War Memorial* and up into right facing, undercut flake crack above.  
*F.A. Bob Conway and Chris Jackson 1979 with 1pt of aid. F.F.A. Jerry Frost 1980*

**1. War Memorial (6c) *&starf;***  
Climb the wall and move left into the flake crack of *Fey* and finish up this.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1983*

**2. Succubus (7b+) *&starf;&starf;***  
Takes the wall R of War Memorial up to and through the bulge to gain the arete above. A long sling is often used on the first bolt above the bulge to make clipping easier. Tough.  
*F.A. Seb Grieve 1994*

**Shazam E4 6a *&starf;***  
Climbs the obvious thin crack, bulge and and hanging groove. The last trad route on The Cornice?  
*F.A. Jerry Moffatt 1982*

**3. Martial Music (7a+) *&starf;&starf;***  
Takes the technical wall R of Shazam to below the roof. Move right before pulling over and up to the belay.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1983*

**4. Clarion Call (7a) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Classic and perhaps the UK's first sport route. Technical start and sustained above.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1983*

**5. The Poppy Fields (7b+)**  
A suprisingly good eliminate squeezed onto the rock between the two classics.  
*F.A. Simon Lee 2004*

**6. Armistice Day (7a) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Sustained throughout with crux through obvious overlap.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1984*

**7. Who's Line is it Anyway (7a+) *&starf;&starf;&starf;***  
Another fine sustained pitch with hard moves direct at 2nd BR and 4th.  
*F.A. Jon de Montjoye 1989*

**8. Big Store E5 6b *&starf;&starf;***  
Still trad. Good climbing via arched groove and a span left.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1984*

**9. The Egyptian Bizarre (7a+) *&starf;***  
A direct and fully bolted direct finish to *Big Store*.  
*F.A. Jon de Montjoye 1989*

**10. Big Zipper (7a+) *&starf;&starf;***  
Line to right. Fingery rightwards exit through bulge.  
*F.A. Gary Gibson 1986*

**11. Beelzebub (7b+)**  
The direct finish to *Big Zipper* consists of a short powerful boulder problem. Can also been climbed by starting up *Bored* for increased difficutly.
*F.A. Seb Grieve 1996*

**12. Bored of the Lies (7b+) *&starf;&starf;***  
An excellent wall pitch. Now usually finished up *Big Zipper* though the original and harder finish traversed right at lower level before going up.  
*Mark Pretty 1986*

**13. Ouijaboard (8a) *&starf;&starf;***  
Harder and more fingery wall to right. Harder the higher you get.  
*F.A. Dave Cross 1987*

**14. Four Door Dostoyevsky (8a+) *&starf;&starf;***  
The shallow curving groove with desperate technicalities above break. Sharp.  
*F.A. Sean Myles 1989*

**15. Powerplant (8a) *&starf;&starf;&starf;*** 
The classic of its grade in the Dale. The difficulties are centred around the overlap. **Powerpant (8a)** connects *Powerplant* with *Devonshire Arms* from just the first crux on the former.  
*F.A. Chris Plant 1988*

In the great British tradition of horizontal climbing a traverse of this wall has been climbed:

**Tour de France (7a)**  
Climb up *Fey* to the base of the groove then traverse right to the lower off on *Egyptian Bizarre*. An ascent is unlikely to endear you to other climbers at the crag.
