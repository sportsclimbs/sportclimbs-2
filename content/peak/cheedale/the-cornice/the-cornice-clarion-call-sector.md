![The Cornice Clarion Call topo](/img/peak/cheedale/corncct.gif)

**1. Clarion Call (6c+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
Classic. Technical start and sustained above.

**The Poppy Fields (7b+)**  
A suprisingly good eliminate squeezed onto the rock between the two classics.

**2. Armistice Day (7a) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
Sustained throughout with crux through obvious overlap.

**3. Who's Line is it Anyway (7a+) &starf;&starf;**  
Another fine sustained pitch with hard moves direct at 2nd BR and 4th.

**4. Big Store E5 6b &starf;&starf;** trad. climbing via arched groove and span left

**5. The Egyptian Bizarre E5 6b** direct finish to Big Store, 2BRs.

**6. Big Zipper (7a+) &starf;**  
Line to right. Fingery rightwards exit through bulge.

**7. Bored of the Lies (7b+)** &starf;&starf;  
An excellent wall pitch. Technical and sustained with crux right and up at top.

**8. Ouijaboard (8a)** &starf;&starf;  
Harder and more fingery wall to right. Harder the higher you get.

**9. Four Door Dostoyevsky (8a+) &starf;&starf;** shallow curving groove with desperate technicalities above break. Sharp.

**10. Powerplant (8a)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
The classic of its grade in the Dale. The difficulties are centred around the overlap. **Powerpant (8a)** connects *Powerplant* with *Devonshire Arms* from just the first crux on the former.

**11. Devonshire Arms (8a+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
The even more powerful wall to the right. Crimps, pinches provide the sequence.

**12. K3 (8a+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
Undercutting nightmare leftwards through bulge and finally up.

**12a K5 (8b)**  
Start up *K3* but when you get to the 'pancake' undercuts step left into *Devonshire Arms* then left again into *Powerplant* above the crux, finish up this.

**12b K2 (8c)**  
Continues from *Poweplant* across *Fourdoor* to the belay of Bored.

**13. 42 (8b+) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
A more direct line than *K3* after flat flake. Hardest route hereabouts.

**13a 32 (8b+)** &starf;&starf;  
The bulges to the right to join R'n P.

**14. R'n'P (8a+)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
Mean. More undercuts to the right gain the upper wall at a scoop. Easier above?

**Barney Ragin' (8b+) &starf;&starf;**  
Starts up *R'n'P* but goes R through the bulge via a slot and continues up to join and finish up *Love Amongst the Butterflies* Links the start of *R'n'P* with *Love Amongst the Butterflies*.

**15. Love Amongst the Butterflies (8b)** &starf;&starf;&starf;  
The antithesis of all to the left. Technicalities in the extreme. Keep crimping.

**16. Asia Shadow Player (8b)** &starf;&starf;  
A direct finish to *Butterflies*. Hideous.

**Somehow Super (8c)** &starf;&starf;  
Starts as for *Love Amongst the Butterflies* but go straight up.
