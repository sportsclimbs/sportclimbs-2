![The Armblaster sector topo](/img/peak/cheedale/cornarm.gif)

**Forehead Trombones (7b+) &starf;**  
An obvious flake groove above the 8th stepping stone with a hard bulge above. 

**Sharp Practice (8a+) &starf;&starf;**  
The desperate leaning wall above the first steeping stone 

**1. Masculine Power Trip (8a+) &starf;**  
The even more desperate overhanging thin crack, shallow groove line 

**2. Mescaline Power Trip (8a) &starf;**  
Tough stuff off a pile of boulders. The bulge above provides a double wammy. 

**3. Wright-On (7c+) &starf;**  
More bouldery moves onto slab and another double wammy overlap. 

**4. Wright to Left (7c) &starf;**  
Hard moves into hanging groove then the line takes the name of the route, well almost. 

**5. Taylor Made (7c) &starf;&starf;**  
Into the groove then the left-hand exit through the overlap. Powerful for the grade.

**6. Feminine Ego Trip (7c+) &starf;**  
The right-hand exit from the groove with a particularly trying final move. 

**7. Nemesis (8a+) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
Overhanging fingerboard/cellar climbing to the top. Starts just left of impressive groove. The is a Right-Hand Finish (8b) &starf;&starf;&starf; finishing right and up after the original's crux. 

**Clematis (8b) &starf;&starf;**  
A harder finish to Nemesis. NB. Finish on the jugs at the top of the crag and then drop back down to the belay.

**Bricktop (8b) &starf;&starf;**  
Breaks out from Nemesis where that route moves L and climbs directly up the wall above.

**8. Monumental Armblaster (8a+) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
The major diagonal L to R groove line provides a major classic but is rarely completely dry. Knee bars, fingery moves etc, etc. 

**9. Malcolm X (8b+) &starf;&starf;&starf;** 
Another major line crossing the Armblaster into even steeper terrain. 

**Gran Tetcho (8b) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
Large roof and left to right flakeline about 25ft left of jug Jockey.  

**Techno Prisoners (8b+)**  
Obvious and nails!

**10. The Jug Jockey (7c+) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
A powerful problem through the centre of the strip roof. Start via crescent-shaped flake. 

**Easy Rider (7c+) &starf;&starf;**  
Up Jug Jockey to the roof then swarm right along a break to a tricky exit and easier headwall. 

**11. Dreadnought (8c) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
Orange-coloured wall, then the roof, then the crux! Stunning 

**12. Roof Warrior (8a) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
More roof climbing taking the end of the roof. Brilliant. 

**13. Cry of Despair (7c) &starf;&starf;&starf;**  
At last easier but no less fine. Gain the hanging groove by sustained moves. Exit carefully. 

**14. Rapid City (8a) &starf;**  
Desperate moves off a high sloper and equally hard moves through overlap.
