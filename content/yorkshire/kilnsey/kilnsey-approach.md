## Approach

This roadside crag is unmissable when driving North on the B6160 from Skipton.

There are a few small roadside laybys directly in front of the crag. If these are full there is more space in a layby about half a kilometre past the crag on the right.

A stream prevents access to the cliff from point on the road. The usual crossing place is at the South end of the crag where a path leads up to the imposing roof capped Directissima wall.

## Access

The crag is on private land. The owner allows climbing but asks that no dogs be taken to the crag.
