Clwyd Limestone refer to the long, west facing escarpment of limestone that stretches northwards from the town of Llangollen and is about 45 minutes south west of Chester. It is perhaps the forgotten area of UK sport climbing, perhaps because of a lack of guides or maybe the lack of famous groundbreaking routes. But rock is good quality limestone situated in the idylic Eglwyseg valley.
