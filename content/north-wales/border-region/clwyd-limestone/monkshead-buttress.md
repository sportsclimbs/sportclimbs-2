**1. Hunky Monk (6b+)**
Slight bulge and wall

**2. The After Eights (7b+)**
Widest part of overhang and desperate wall.

**3. People Give me the Eyes (7c) *★***
The gently leaning wall. Sustained, fingery, technical and powerful.

**4. Yankee Doodle Dandy (7b+) *★***
Desperate moves past the BRs to gain the tree.

**5. I Feel Like a Wog (7b) *★***
Another desperate sequence to gain jugs and marginally easier moves above.

**6. Too Monk to Funk (7c)**
Desperate fingery overlaps

**7. Yoyoyoyo E3 6a**
The prominent flake gives a surprisingly difficult sequence.

**8. Golly Gee E4 6b *★***
A fine shallow groove on black rock.

**9. Golly Gosh E2 6a *★***
The next more obvious groove.

**10. Indian Summer E4 6b *★***
A flaky wall to gain a rib and leftwards exit.

**11. Golly Wog E4 6a**
A thin crack splitting the wall.

**12. Swiss Drum Roll E5 6b *★***
The final technical wall
