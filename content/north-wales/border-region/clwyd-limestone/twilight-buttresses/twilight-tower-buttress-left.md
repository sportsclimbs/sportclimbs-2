The barrell-shaped arête with a few brittle holds.

The superb corner line with an exciting finish around the top overhang.

Another fine climb taking the thin crack and impressive layback flake above.

The thin crackline just right again and finishing via the right-hand fork and wider crack above.

The obvious broken crackline via two dead yew trees.
