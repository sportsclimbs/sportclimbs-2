**1. On Line S**  
A steep layback crack gains easier ground above.

**2. Extension VS 4c**  
The barrell-shaped arête with a few brittle holds.

**3. Funeral Corner HS *★★***  
The superb corner line with an exciting finish around the top overhang.

**4. Inter Digital Pause HVS 5a**  
The arête right of the corner with tricky moves past an old PR.

**5. Penetration Factor VS 4c *★***  
Another fine climb taking the thin crack and impressive layback flake above.

**6. Sidestep HVS 4c**  
The thin crackline just right again and finishing via the right-hand fork and wider crack above.

**7. Ruth's Ramble VD**  
The obvious broken crackline via two dead yew trees.

**8. Loran S *★***  
Another pleasant route via a flake crack, bulge and awkward moves past a yew tree.

Another gem taking the wall and slab to the right.
