## Independence right

![Independence Quarry topo right-hand](/img/north-wales/border-region/clwyd-limestone/Independance-RH.jpg)
{.topo .w100}

**1. India (6b)**  
A pleasant route up a slight groove with an unusual exit leftwards. Reachy.

**2. The Last Crusade (6c+)**  
Difficult and fingery moves from ledge with scary clip. Pre-clip 3rd BR.

**3. Independence (6b) *★***  
A fine sustained face climb via a blunt rib.

**4. I Don't Agree (6b+) *★★***  
This goes directly up the centre of the fine black face with excellent rock and climbing.

**5. Independence Day (6b+) *★★***  
The left-centre of face gives a fine companion to the last route.

**6. Oh Calcutta (6a)**  
The shallow groove system on the left-hand side of the face gives a nice easier route or a warm-up. Keep to the line of BRs.

**7. The Indi Mix (6c)**  
A short, difficult route past a prominent layback edge.

## Independence left

**8. Indi-Pops (6c)**  
A fine climb up a short wall and prominent overlap which is taken on the left.

**9. Indiana Jones (6a+)**  
Gain the prominent cracks via a hard move through the overlap. Finish leftwards.

**10. Into the Fire (7a) *★***  
A superb route through an overlap and up the shallow black groove. Fingery through the overlap.

**11. Augustus Gloop (6a+) *★***  
Another good route taking the hanging black scoop and the pleasant wall above.

**12. Verruca Salt (6b) *★***  
More good climbing up the cracked overlap and the blunt rib above.  Marginally harder than the last route.

**13. Roald Dahling (6c) *★***  
Superb climbing on the upper wall after a problematic move through the overlap. High in the grade.

**14. Umpalumpa Groove (5)**  
The obvious crackline has an awkward finish.

**15. Ump and Over (6a)**  
Climb the blunt rib and pleasant face with tricky finish.

**16. Beauregarde (6a+) *★***  
Face with awkward overlap and excellent face above.

**17. No Regard (6b)**  
A difficult overlap is followed by a pleasant face above moving rightwards.

**18. Is This as Good as it Gets (6c+) *★***  
Desperate entry onto face via groove and fine rib above.

**19. It Seems So (6a+)**  
A short wall, pleasant groove and a steep finish to the belay.

**20. Consider an Evil (6a+)**  
Another short wall and tricky overlap. Easier above via short groove.
