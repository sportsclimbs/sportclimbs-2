<p><b>1. India (6b) </b>pleasant slight groove with unusual exit leftwards. Reachy.</p>
<p><b>2. The Last Crusade (6c+) </b>Difficult and fingery moves from ledge with scary clip. Pre-clip 3rd BR.</p>
<p><b>3. Independence (6b) &starf; </b>fine sustained face climbing via a blunt rib.</p>
<p><b>4. I Don't Agree (6b+) &starf;&starf; </b>direct up the centre of the fine black face with excellent rock and climbing.</p>
<p><b>5. Independence Day (6b+) &starf;&starf; </b>left-centre of face gives a fine companion tot he last route.</p>
<p><b>6. Oh Calcutta (6a) </b>the shallow groove system on the left-hand side of the face gives the warm-up. Keep to the line of BRs.</p>
<p><b>7. The Indi Mix (6c) </b>short difficult route past prominent layback edge.</p>

<p><b>8. Indi-Pops (6c) </b>fine climbing via a short wall and prominent overlap taken on the left.</p>
<p><b>9. Indiana Jones (6a+) </b>gains the prominent cracks via a hard move through the overlap. Finish leftwards.</p>
<p><b>10. Into the Fire (7a) &starf; </b>superb climbing via an overlap and shallow black groove. Fingery at the crux through the overlap.</p>
<p><b>11. Augustus Gloop (6a+) &starf; </b>another good route taking the hanging black scoop and the pleasant wall above.</p>
<p><b>12. Verruca Salt (6b) &starf; </b>another good route taking the cracked overlap and the blunt rib above. Harder, marginally, that the last route.</p>
<p><b>13. Roald Dahling (6c) &starf; </b>superb climbing on the upper wall after a problematic move through the overlap. High in the grade.</p>
<p><b>14. Umpalumpa Groove (5) </b>obvious crackline with awkward finale</p>
<p><b>15. Ump and Over (6a) </b>blunt rib and pleasant face with tricky finish.</p>
<p><b>16. Beauregarde (6a+) &starf; </b>Face with awkward overlap and excellent face above.</p>
<p><b>17. No Regard (6b) </b>a more difficult overlap and pleasant face above moving rightwards.</p>
<p><b>18. Is This as Good as it Gets (6c+) &starf; </b>desperate entry onto face via groove and fine rib above.</p>
<p><b>19. It Seems So (6a+) </b>short wall, pleasant groove and steep finish to belay.</p>
<p><b>20. Consider an Evil (6a+) </b>another short wall and tricky overlap. Easier above via short groove.</p>
