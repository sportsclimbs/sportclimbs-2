            <h3>Approaches and Layout</h3>

            <p>Very easy to find with ease of access as long as you park in the right place. </p>

            <p>Take the road from Ruabon to Llangollen and turn right (or left if travelling from Llangollen) at the Sun Trevor Inn. Follow this road past one hairpin bend and over one cattle grid and park carefully on the left 100m after the latter. Walk further up the road for 50m and climb the banking by a large Oak tree into the quarry. The wall is obvious off to the left.</p>

                <p>Due to the presence of nesting Peregrine Falcons in this quarry, please respect the requested restrictions from 15th Feb to 15th July or until nesting fledglings have flown.</p>
