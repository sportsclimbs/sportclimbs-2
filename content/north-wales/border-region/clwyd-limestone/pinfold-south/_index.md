The best approach is from Llangollen. Cross the bridge over the river Dee from the A5 and turn right. Take the first left on this road and follow it over the canal bridge and onto Dinbren Road. Follow this for 2km until a T junction is reach - Dinbren crags can be seen above. Turn left along the road to a lay-by on the right-hand side below a crag high on the hillside.

Walk down the road and through a gate in 50m. Turn right off the track and follow the path up the broad gully, this is just before a small cottage, to below the crags which lie on the left-hand side of the track.

## Character

A superb little venue of generally excellent rock with a mixture of easier traditional routes and some with a mixture of fixed gear. There are even some two pitch routes towards its left-hand side.

The cliff gets any afternoon sunshine going, dries very quickly and its quick access makes it the ideal evening or short visit venue.
