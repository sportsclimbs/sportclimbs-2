            <p><b>1. Scrapyard Thing (E1 5a, 5a) </b>a poor route up the left-hand side of the buttress
                <ol>
                    <li>20m start via a loose flake crack and continue via the wall above to a belay below an overlap. </li>
                    <li>12m pass the overhang to its left to reach a ledge and finish via the chimney on the right.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>2. Double Crossbones (E3 5c, 5a, 5a) * </b>Another wandering climb with a fine first pitch.
                <ol>
                    <li>12m Up via the obvious gray wall past a peg runner to a belay below an overhang. </li>
                    <li>12m tackle the overhang and corner to a ledge belay. </li>
                    <li>Move back right and continue up the corner to reach an overhang. Pass this to the right and move right to finish via a broken exit corner</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>3. Those Stumbling Words (7a) *</b> a gooddirect line through two overlaps with a superb finale on the headwall after a hard, boulder-problem start which can be avoided on the left.</p>
            <p><b>4. Delaware Slide (E4 6a) ** </b>A fine pitch taking the left-hand side of the barrel-shaped wall following a vague rib. Escalating difficulties to a tricky finish on the line of some old BRs</p>
            <p><b>5. These Foolish Things (7a+) *** </b>a superb sustained exercise up the centre of the wall beginning on the obvious ramp line and following a system of scoops and bulges to finish on the headwall with a final crux flourish.</p>
            <p><b>6. Gates of the Golden Dawn (E5 5b, 6b) ** </b>a two pitch route taking the vague rib in the centre of the buttress, PRs, and the final overhang by a short bouldery and difficult sequence.</p>
            <p><b>7. Sunny Side Up Mix (7b) *** </b>Begins from a higher level. A magnificent pitch taking the right-hand side of the rib via sustained moves to finish via the final jutting prow. Memorable. </p>
            <p><b>8. Black Poppies (7b+) ** </b>the vague depression to the right with a series of taxing moves (short-lived) to gain easier ground. The final roof is taken via an impressive crack. </p>
            <p><b>9. Chilean Moon (7b) * </b>Another sustained little affair with a hard section low down through the initial roof to easier climbing and a difficult finale over the roof. </p>
            <p><b>10. Acapulco (7a+) * </b>Another taxing route with a difficult section low down and easier climbing above. </p>
            <p><b>11. Chills of Apprehension (E4 6a) * </b>The rightward trending weakness, PRs, with difficulty, then head up he wall to the wide finishing crack.</p>
            <p><b>12. Jam Spread (6b+) </b>short difficult bulge, shallow groove and short wall.</p>
            <p><b>13. Lemon Kerred (6c+) </b>A short test piece on the final rounded buttress.</p>
            <p><b>14.Freshly Dug (6a) </b>pleasant face on fringe of wall.</p>
