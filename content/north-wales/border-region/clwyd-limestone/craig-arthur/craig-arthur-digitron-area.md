**1. Rubs and Tugs (7c) *★***  
Tackle the left-hand side of the large roof above the impressive mid-height yew tree. This can be gained by easier climbing from below and to the left.

**2. Eliminator (E4 6a) *★★***  
A superb top pitch. Start 9m right of the large yew tree.

1.  18m Climb a shallow corner, then trend leftwards to a belay in a curved bay.
2.  18m Gain the tiered overlaps and power through these, 2PRs, into a smooth-looking recess, TR. Technical climbing up this and through a bulge, PR, gains the top.

**3. Pi (8a) *★★***  
An impressive line right of the roofs via a shallow groove and desperately fingery headwall.

**4. California Highway Patrol (7c) *★★★***  
Another superb pitch tackling the right-hand side of the impressive white headwall and gained via an unpleasant start. Once over the initial bulge and brilliant sequence leads up via a shallow groove and tough headwall.

**5. Tito (E1 5b, 5a)**  
A meandering route with some interest. Start towards the right-hand side of the bay below the overlaps in the upper walls.

1.  18m Follow a shallow groove before moving rightwards across the gray slab, Pr, to reach a bulge. Move up, step right to gain a belay below a strip overhang.
2.  21m Pass the overhang to gain a crack. Finish slightly leftwards on dubious rock and via a faint scoop.

**6. About Time (7b) *★★★***  
Bisects the line of Tito via some low technical moves and an easy central section before stepping right and climbing a shallow scoop in the headwall to a very taxing finale on small holds. Superb climbing but frustrating at the top.

**7. Pour Lulubelle (E3 5c) *★***  
A new classic taking the difficult smooth wall, PR and BR to the main overlap. Above this take the superbly positioned blunt rib via cracks and edges.

**8. Digitron (E2 5c) *★★★***  
Superb climbing with the crux towards the top. Start 5m left of a steep and rounded gray arête. Straightforward climbing on the lower wall, PR, gains a small tree slightly to the right. Continue straight up past a second PR to a short slab and faint crack in a bulge, PR. Pull over this and pass to the right of the next overlap to reach a break on the rib. Magnificent climbing slightly leftwards gains a flake, PR, and a tricky move to gain easier ground leading to the top.

**9. Heaven or Hell (E5 6b) *★★★***  
Another classic pitch well worth seeking out. If combined with Digitron gives a brilliant E5 6a. Start just right of the impressive rounded gray rib. Climb the vague pocketed ramp and make a series of blind moves leftwards, BR, to reach a good hold at the base of a tiny groove. Stand up and pull out onto the arête, which is climbed on its right-hand side to a break (junction with Digitron). Step right and surmount the bulge rightwards, BR, move back left onto the slab and a junction with Digitron at its crux.
