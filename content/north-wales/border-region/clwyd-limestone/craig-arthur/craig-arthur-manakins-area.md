            <p><b>1. Three Dimensions (E2 5b, 5a) &starf;&starf;</b></p>
            <p><b>2. The Marsh Flower (E3 6a) &starf; </b>An interesting pitch on the open grey slab with a short tricky section. From below the centre of the slab, climb straight up heading for an obvious blank-looking section, BR. Climb this and continue fairly direct, gradually easing off, to a break. Finish more easily via a crack above.</p>
            <p><b>3. Legacy (HVS 5a, 5a) </b>Begin just left of a prominent yew tree
                <ol>
                    <li>19m From the foot of the slab, move left onto a small ledge and then continue leftwards more easily to a tree belay in a large bay.</li>
                    <li>2. 20m Traverse right along the prominent break system to finish via a crack above some blocks.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>4. Stratagem (E2 5b) &starf;&starf; </b>A fine route. From the start of Legacy, climb pleasantly up the slab to a bulge at its top, PR. Move carefully leftwards to reach a break, then move back right and continue up a tree and the large blocks on Legacy. Finish up the crack above.</p>
            <p><b>5. Manikins of Horror (E3 5c) &starf;&starf;&starf; </b>A classic. From just right of the small yew tree, gain a break and move left into a small corner, PR. Continue carefully leftwards around the blunt rib onto a steep slab at the foot of a crack. Climb the crack, PRs, to the girdle break. Move left and finish straight up.</p>
            <p><b>6. Swlabr Link (E3 6a, 5a) &starf;&starf; </b>A fine but wandering lower pitch.
                <ol>
                    <li>24m Follow Manikins past its first PR, then continue straight up to the break, a little contrived. Traverse right along the break, 2PRs to gain a crack leading more easily to a large ledge and tree belay. </li>
                    <li>15m Climb the prominent steep crack above.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>7. Dance of the Puppets (E6 6b) &starf;&starf; </b>A fine hard direct route, low in the grade. Climb the shallow groove just right again to gain a good pocket and bold moves leftwards to reach a break. Tackle the difficult and fingery bulge above, BR, to reach another break and TR. Continue delicately rightwards into a scoop and swing left from a niche, PRs. Exit rightwards, TR, to finish.</p>

            <p><b>8. Swlabr (HVS 4b, 5b) </b>Start below and to the left of the large yew tree in the bay to the right.
                <ol>
                    <li>20m climb slightly leftwards up the wall, poor rock, past an ivy patch. Step left to belay on a large ledge.</li>
                    <li>15m the groove and prominent crack above.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>9. Eliminator (E4 6a) &starf;&starf; </b>A superb top pitch. Start 9m right of the large yew tree.
                <ol>
                    <li>18m Climb a shallow corner, then trend leftwards to a belay in a curved bay.</li>
                    <li>18m Gain the tiered overlaps and power through these, 2PRs, into a smooth-looking recess, TR. Technical climbing up this and through a bulge, PR, gains the top.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>10. Pi (8a) &starf;&starf; </b>impressive line right of roofs via shallow groove and desperately fingery headwall.</p>
