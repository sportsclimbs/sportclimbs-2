{.topo}

The crag now reappears again after a large grassy ramp and some poor rock. This area through the Nemesis Wall is probably the most impressive bit of rock on the crag.

**1. Digitron (E2 5c) *★★★***  
Superb climbing with the crux towards the top. Start 5m left of a steep and rounded gray arête. Straightforward climbing on the lower wall, PR, gains a small tree slightly to the right. Continue straight up past a second PR to a short slab and faint crack in a bulge, PR. Pull over this and pass to the right of the next overlap to reach a break on the rib. Magnificent climbing slightly leftwards gains a flake, PR, and a tricky move to gain easier ground leading to the top.

**2. Heaven or Hell (E5 6b) *★★★***  
Another classic pitch well worth seeking out. If combined with Digitron gives a brilliant E5 6a. Start just right of the impressive rounded gray rib. Climb the vague pocketed ramp and make a series of blind moves leftwards, BR, to reach a good hold at the base of a tiny groove. Stand up and pull out onto the arête, which is climbed on its right-hand side to a break (junction with Digitron). Step right and surmount the bulge rightwards, BR, move back left onto the slab and a junction with Digitron at its crux.

**3. Beta Beware (6c+) *★***  
A short intense affair through a difficult series of overlaps to an easier wall and tree belay.

**4. Omegod (6c+)**  
gain the prominent flake from below and exit it rightwards and over a small overlap onto the wall above. The superb blunt rib above leads to the belay.

**5. Alpha Track Etch (7b) *★★***  
A very touch pitch with some good climbing throughout. It climbs the front face of the broad rounded buttress with a smattering of bolt runners and plenty of technical climbing. Some Friends/wires may be required before the first BR.

**6. Delta Force (6c+) *★★***  
The right arête of the face gives an excellent face climb with sustained but reasonable climbing to an intricate and fingery finale on the superb final bulge.

**7. Badge (E1 5c, 4c)**  
A poor route. Start 4m right of Alpha Track Etc.

1.  20m Pass an overhang, PR, to reach a groove and follow this, PR, to reach a scoop and belay.
2.  12m Finish via the scoop, exiting left below a bulge via a wall.

**8. Keeping Secrets (E5 6c) *★***  
Begin at a slightly higher level. Good climbing but tough at the crux. From a small tree, stand up and enter a shallow scoop, PR, to reach better holds. Climb the flake on the left pas a thin break, PR, to reach a V-shaped groove. Swing out left to exit via a lichen-flecked wall.

**9. Walls Have Ears (7b+) *★***  
Start 5m right again. Climb a faint flake and bulge to a good ledge. The finish through the hanging scoop gives a hard sequence with a very reachy clip.

**10. Scary Fairy (E3 5c, 5b)**  
Start below an obvious flake further right.

1.  12m  
    Gain the flake by strenuous moves and follow it steeply to a cave belay.
2.  2. 17m  
    Move left to a junction with Keeping Secrets at the V-shaped groove and finish up it.

**11. Ten (7c) *★★***  
A brilliant pitch up the fine wall and impressive large bulge right of Scary Fairy. Straightforward, relatively, to the bulge where the interest begins in a sequence of powerful and demanding moves.

**12. When I was a Viking (6b)**  
An easy but pleasant lower wall leads to fine climbing above the ledge.

**13. Ravenous (6b)**  
An easy lower wall to fine upper section via flakes and cracks.
