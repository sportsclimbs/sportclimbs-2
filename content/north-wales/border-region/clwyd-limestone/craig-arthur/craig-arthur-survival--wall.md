The crag now reappears again after a large grassy ramp and some poor rock. This area through the Nemesis Wall is probably the most impressive bit of rock on the crag.

**1. Charlain (HVS 5a, 5a)**  
Pleasant. Start at the left-hand side of the grey wall, 5m left of a slim white groove.
{.mt0}

1.  21m Climb the wall past a break, PR, and after a bulge trend rightwards, PR, until atop a large block. Step right before continue up to a small ledge and tree.
2.  2. 12m Move up and right to a tree then move left via a break and up via a crack.

**2. Now and Then (E2 5b, 5a)**  
Slighty better climbing.

1.  **21m**  
    Fine climbing up the slim white groove leads past 2PRs to a small overlap. Pull over this, PR, to gain better holds leading to a tree belay.
2.  **12m**  
    Finish as for Charlain.

**3. Dead Man's Creek (E4 6a) *★***  
Getting better. Gain and climb the obvious flake in the wall to the right, BR, until moves slightly rightwards and up gain a PR. Continue direct past a jammed wire until a step left and easier moves up gain a Peg belay for lower-off.

**4. Punch and Judy (E5 6b) *★★★***  
A true technical classic, probably more like 7a+. Start 8m right of Now and The. Gain a flake and cross the difficult bulge to gain a break. Stand up and traverse delicately right to reach a shallow groove which eases in difficult for the lower-off to be gained. Plenty of fixed gear.

**5. Full Mental Jacket (E5 6c) *★***  
A hard eliminate based around Punch and Judy. Starting 5m further right, cross a flaky bulge onto a small ledge, then step left and up past BRs to reach a break. Stand up and move slightly left to follow a faint groove to reach goods holds. Move slightly left again, then straight up to the belay. Fixed gear.

**6. Survival of the Fastest (E4 6a) *★★★***  
A true classic of the early eighties with sustained difficulties on a fine line. From the start of Full Mental Jacket, pull rightwards through the bulge to reach the crackline, PR. Climb this, gradually increasing in difficulty to a slight bulge, PRs. Cross this leftwards past a BR with a hard move, and move up to a break, PR. Finish via a slab and straightforward crackline.

**7. Survival of the Fattest (E5 6b)**  
A hard crux section with easier climbing above and below. Starting 5m right of Survival of the Fastest, cross an awkward bulge to gain a series of small flakes leading to a bulge at 20m. Hard moves through this gain an overlap and a finishing crack to its left.

**8. Friday the Thirteenth (E5 6a, 5c) *★★★***  

**9. Manic Mechanic (E5 6b) *★★★***
