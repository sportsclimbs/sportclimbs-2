            <p><b>1. Kitten's Paws (6c+) </b>a bizarre route touching the right-hand side of the detached flake and making hard moves from its top. The flake has been well tested.</p>
            <p><b>2. Was it Stew (6c+) * </b>A good route on the gleaming white pillar at the left end of the face. Exit left and up from the break after the hard move. </p>
            <p><b>3. The Fall and Decline (E3 5c, 5a) * </b>Steep and satisfying on a strong line. Start below a prominent square-cut corner.
                <ol>
                    <li>25m Climb the wall to reach a leftward-trending flake. Follow this to an overlap and swing left and up to gain a groove. Follow this, moving right onto the arete and then up to a ledge.</li>
                    <li>12m Climb the overhangs via a break.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>4. La Chacal (E2 5c) *</b>Another classy pitch with strenuous climbing on a good line.
                <ol>
                    <li>25m </b>From the foot of the leftward-trending crack on Fall and Decline, move right and up a square-cut corner to a roof. Swing out right in a fine position and then gain the yellow-flecked wall above. Good holds on this lead upwards before a traverse right gain a small ledge.</li>
                <li>12m </b>Climb the flake right of the stance moving right and then up an easy groove.</li>
                </ol>

            </p>
            <p><b>5. A Touch of Class (E2 5b, 5b, 5a) *** </b>A classic expedition finding a way across the face in typical 80s style.
                <ol>
                    <li>25m From the first horizontal break on La Chacal, move right and climb the compact wall to a PR on the left-hand side of a white wall. Traverse carefully right across this, PR, to reach a ramp/slab. Belay below the roofs at the top of this.</li>
                    <li>15m Continue the traverse right to reach a steep groove line. Follow this to a TR, then swing right to the shattered arete, PR. Climb this and a short wall to a tree belay.</li>
                    <li>Traverse back left along the ledge to a rounded arete and finish via this.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>6. Front of House (6c+) *</b> Takes a direct line from the blunt rib and through the overlaps to the belay of La Chacal.</p>
            <p><b><b>7. Back Yard Holiday (6c+) ** </b></b>A fine single pitch route with plenty of climbing trending rightwards across the wall with a fingery lower section and a difficult move through the overlap. </p>
            <p><b>8. Swelling Itching Brain (7b+) * </b>A tough technical section low down with easier climbing once it has gained the upper section of the last route.</p>
            <p><b>9. One Continuous Picnic (7b) ** </b>A fabulous pitch with sustained hard climbing but good gear. Start at the right-hand end of the slim wall preventing entry to its upper section. Move up to the break (prickly bush) and follow a series of thin flakes and cracks direct to a respite below the right-hand side of a large overlap. Pull up and leftwards on good holds to gain easier climbing leading to a ledge and easier ground above. </p>
            <p><b>10. Three Dimensions (E2 5b, 5b) ** </b>Another classy pitch on the right-hand side of the wall. Start below a leftwards-trending flake line.
                <ol>
                    <li>27m Climb a short corner and overcome the overlap in favour of the flake line. Follow this to a small ledge, PR, then move right and up into a crackline. Avoid the large overhang above for a bottomless groove on the left (junction with Touch of Class) and follow this exiting right at a TR onto the right-hand arete, PR. This leads to a ledge and belay.</li>
                    <li>12m Move left into a corner and follow this via its upper roof.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>11. Sugar Sweet (6c+) *</b> difficult lower bulge with fine upper section.</p>
            <p><b>11a Mon Miel (6c) </b>a short route with a difficult bulge.</p>
            <p><b>12. A Bitter Pill (6b)</b> a pleasant warm up straight through a small mid-height bulge.</p>
            <p><b>13. A Cunning Plan (6b+) * </b>a direct line through the lower bulge and up the left-hand edge of the slabby face gives a very pleasant pitch.</p>
            <p><b>14. The Marsh Flower (7a) * </b>An interesting pitch on the open gray slab with a short tricky (desperate) section. From below the centre of the slab, climb straight up heading for an obvious blank-looking section. Climb this and continue fairly direct, gradually easing off, to a break. Finish more easily via a crack above. </p>
            <p><b>15. Stratagem E2 5b ** </b>A fine route. From the start of Legacy, climb pleasantly up the slab to a bulge at its top, PR. Move carefully leftwards to reach a break, then move back right and continue up a tree and the large blocks on Legacy. Finish up the crack above.</p>
            <p><b>16. Manikins of Horror E3 5c *** </b>A classic. From just right of the small yew tree, gain a break and move left into a small corner, PR. Continue carefully leftwards around the blunt rib onto a steep slab at the foot of a crack. Climb the crack, PRs, to the girdle break. Move left and finish straight up.</p>
            <p><b>Swlabr Link (E3 6a, 5a) ** </b>A fine but wandering lower pitch.
                <ol>
                    <li>24m </b>Follow Manikins past its first PR, then continue straight up to the break, a little contrived. Traverse right along the break, 2PRs to gain a crack leading more easily to a large ledge and tree belay.</li>
                <li>15m </b>Climb the prominent steep crack above.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>17. Masquerade (7b+) ** </b>a fine direct line up the left-hand side of the buttress with a very technical move at half height and sustained climbing above. Harder for the short?</p>
            <p><b>18. Dance of the Puppets (7b) **</b>A fine hard direct route, low in the grade. Climb the shallow groove just right again to gain a good pocket and bold moves leftwards to reach a break. Tackle the difficult and fingery bulge above to reach another break. Continue delicately rightwards into a scoop and swing left from a niche exiting rightwards.</p>
            <p><b>19. Hand in Glove (7a+) *</b>A good new addition straight up the right-hand side of the wall with a technical lower bulge and sustained climbing above and keeping out of Swlabr. Move left and up to the belay.</p>
