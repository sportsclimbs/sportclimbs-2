**1. Kitten's Paws (6c+)**  
A bizarre route touching the right-hand side of the detached flake and making hard moves from its top. The flake has been well tested.

**2. Was it Stew (6c+) *★***  
A good route on the gleaming white pillar at the left end of the face. Exit left and up from the break after the hard move.

**3. The Fall and Decline (E3 5c, 5a) *★***  
Steep and satisfying on a strong line. Start below a prominent square-cut corner.

1.  25m Climb the wall to reach a leftward-trending flake. Follow this to an overlap and swing left and up to gain a groove. Follow this, moving right onto the arête and then up to a ledge.
2.  12m Climb the overhangs via a break.

**4. La Chacal (E2 5c) *★***  
Another classy pitch with strenuous climbing on a good line.

1.  25m  
    From the foot of the leftward-trending crack on Fall and Decline, move right and up a square-cut corner to a roof. Swing out right in a fine position and then gain the yellow-flecked wall above. Good holds on this lead upwards before a traverse right gain a small ledge.
2.  12m  
    Climb the flake right of the stance moving right and then up an easy groove.

**5. A Touch of Class (E2 5b, 5b, 5a) *★★★***  
A classic expedition finding a way across the face in typical 80s style.

1.  25m From the first horizontal break on La Chacal, move right and climb the compact wall to a PR on the left-hand side of a white wall. Traverse carefully right across this, PR, to reach a ramp/slab. Belay below the roofs at the top of this.
2.  15m Continue the traverse right to reach a steep groove line. Follow this to a TR, then swing right to the shattered arête, PR. Climb this and a short wall to a tree belay.
3.  Traverse back left along the ledge to a rounded arête and finish via this.

**6. Front of House (6c+) *★***  
Takes a direct line from the blunt rib and through the overlaps to the belay of La Chacal.

**7. Back Yard Holiday (6c+) *★★***  
A fine single pitch route with plenty of climbing trending rightwards across the wall with a fingery lower section and a difficult move through the overlap.

**8. Swelling Itching Brain (7b+) *★***  
A tough technical section low down with easier climbing once it has gained the upper section of the last route.

**9. One Continuous Picnic (7b) *★★***  
A fabulous pitch with sustained hard climbing but good gear. Start at the right-hand end of the slim wall preventing entry to its upper section. Move up to the break (prickly bush) and follow a series of thin flakes and cracks direct to a respite below the right-hand side of a large overlap. Pull up and leftwards on good holds to gain easier climbing leading to a ledge and easier ground above.

**10. Three Dimensions (E2 5b, 5b) *★★***  
Another classy pitch on the right-hand side of the wall. Start below a leftwards-trending flake line.

1.  27m Climb a short corner and overcome the overlap in favour of the flake line. Follow this to a small ledge, PR, then move right and up into a crackline. Avoid the large overhang above for a bottomless groove on the left (junction with Touch of Class) and follow this exiting right at a TR onto the right-hand arête, PR. This leads to a ledge and belay.
2.  12m Move left into a corner and follow this via its upper roof.

**11. Sugar Sweet (6c+) *★***  
The difficult lower bulge leads to a fine upper section.

**11a Mon Miel (6c)**  
A short route with a difficult bulge.

**12. A Bitter Pill (6b)**  
A pleasant warm up straight through a small mid-height bulge.

**13. A Cunning Plan (6b+) *★***  
Take a direct line through the lower bulge and then up the left-hand edge of the slabby face above. A good pitch.

**14. The Marsh Flower (7a) *★***  
An interesting pitch on the open gray slab with a short tricky (desperate) section. From below the centre of the slab, climb straight up heading for an obvious blank-looking section. Climb this and continue fairly direct, gradually easing off, to a break. Finish more easily via a crack above.

**15. Stratagem E2 5b *★★***  
A fine route. From the start of Legacy, climb pleasantly up the slab to a bulge at its top, PR. Move carefully leftwards to reach a break, then move back right and continue up a tree and the large blocks on Legacy. Finish up the crack above.

**16. Manikins of Horror E3 5c *★★★***  
A classic. From just right of the small yew tree, gain a break and move left into a small corner, PR. Continue carefully leftwards around the blunt rib onto a steep slab at the foot of a crack. Climb the crack, PRs, to the girdle break. Move left and finish straight up.

**Swlabr Link (E3 6a, 5a) *★★***  
A fine but wandering lower pitch.

1.  24m  
    Follow Manikins past its first PR, then continue straight up to the break, a little contrived. Traverse right along the break, 2PRs to gain a crack leading more easily to a large ledge and tree belay.
2.  15m  
    Climb the prominent steep crack above.

**17. Masquerade (7b+) *★★***  
A fine direct line up the left-hand side of the buttress with a very technical move at half height and sustained climbing above. Harder for the short?

**18. Dance of the Puppets (7b) *★★***  
A fine hard direct route, low in the grade. Climb the shallow groove just right again to gain a good pocket and bold moves leftwards to reach a break. Tackle the difficult and fingery bulge above to reach another break. Continue delicately rightwards into a scoop and swing left from a niche exiting rightwards.

**19. Hand in Glove (7a+) *★***  
A good new addition straight up the right-hand side of the wall with a technical lower bulge and sustained climbing above and keeping out of Swlabr. Move left and up to the belay.
