**1. Scrapyard Thing (E1 5a, 5a)**  
A poor route up the left-hand side of the buttress

1.  20m start via a loose flake crack and continue via the wall above to a belay below an overlap.
2.  12m pass the overhang to its left to reach a ledge and finish via the chimney on the right.

**2. Double Crossbones (E3 5c, 5a, 5a) *★***  
Another wandering climb with a fine first pitch.

1.  12m Up via the obvious gray wall past a peg runner to a belay below an overhang.
2.  12m tackle the overhang and corner to a ledge belay.
3.  Move back right and continue up the corner to reach an overhang. Pass this to the right and move right to finish via a broken exit corner

**3. Those Stumbling Words (7a) *★***  
A gooddirect line through two overlaps with a superb finale on the headwall after a hard, boulder-problem start which can be avoided on the left.

**4. Delaware Slide (E4 6a) *★★***  
A fine pitch taking the left-hand side of the barrel-shaped wall following a vague rib. Escalating difficulties to a tricky finish on the line of some old BRs

**5. These Foolish Things (7a+) *★★★***  
A superb sustained exercise up the centre of the wall beginning on the obvious ramp line and following a system of scoops and bulges to finish on the headwall with a final crux flourish.

**6. Gates of the Golden Dawn (E5 5b, 6b) *★★***  
A two pitch route taking the vague rib in the centre of the buttress, PRs, and the final overhang by a short bouldery and difficult sequence.

**7. Sunny Side Up Mix (7b) *★★★***  
Begins from a higher level. A magnificent pitch taking the right-hand side of the rib via sustained moves to finish via the final jutting prow. Memorable.

**8. Black Poppies (7b+) *★★***  
The vague depression to the right with a series of taxing moves (short-lived) to gain easier ground. The final roof is taken via an impressive crack.

**9. Chilean Moon (7b) *★***  
Another sustained little affair with a hard section low down through the initial roof to easier climbing and a difficult finale over the roof.

**10. Acapulco (7a+) *★***  
Another taxing route with a difficult section low down and easier climbing above.

**11. Chills of Apprehension (E4 6a) *★***  
The rightward trending weakness, PRs, with difficulty, then head up he wall to the wide finishing crack.

**12. Jam Spread (6b+)**  
short difficult bulge, shallow groove and short wall.

**13. Lemon Kerred (6c+)**  
A short test piece on the final rounded buttress.

**14.Freshly Dug (6a)**  
pleasant face on fringe of wall.
