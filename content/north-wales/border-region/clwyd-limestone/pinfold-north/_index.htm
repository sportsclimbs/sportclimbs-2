            <h3>Approach</h3>

Cross the bridge over the river Dee from the A5 and turn right. Take the first left on this road and follow it over the canal bridge and onto Dinbren Road. Follow this for 2km until a T junction is reach - Dinbren crags can be seen above. Turn left along the road to a lay-by on the right-hand side below a crag high on the hillside.</p>

            <p>Walk down the road and through a gate in 50m. Turn right off the track and follow the path up the broad gully, this is just before a small cottage, to below Pinfold South which lies on the left-hand side of the track.</p>

            <p>Follow the track leftwards below this and then below a number of other mediocre buttresses to reach the right-hand side of the escarpment.</p>

            <h3>Character</h3>

            <p>A truly superb venue of generally excellent rock with a mixture of styles of climbing. Some superb and steep mixed/trad. routes are accompanied by an increasing array of superb sport routes. Lower-offs have slowly started to appear which should improve the popularity of these crags.</p>

            <p>The cliff gets any afternoon sunshine going but is very open and can be an extremely cold venue in the winter months. On a summer's evening there is no better place to climb in this area. Needless to say the cliffs dry quickly but do have some stubborn seepage patches after rain</p>
