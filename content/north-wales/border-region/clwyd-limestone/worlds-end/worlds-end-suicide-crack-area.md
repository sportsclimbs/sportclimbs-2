The next section of cliff is identified by a large detached pillar at its right-hand side. It consists of a number of good little routes dominated by the fine blunt arête of Butter arête and the thin crack system of Suicide Crack, both minor classics of the escarpment.

**1. Margarine arête (HVS 5a)**  
The rounded arête passing left and back right at mid-height.
{.mt0}

**2. Whim (HVS 5a) *★★***  
Fine climbing on a line of flakes and cracks to the right.

**3. Windhover (E2 5c) *★★***  
A good route. Climb the white groove and wall to gain a steep finger crack. Climb this with a determined approach to good holds at the top.

**4. Ivy Groove (VS 4b)**  
climbs cracks and a small corner beginning just right of a small pinnacle in the ground.

**5. Butter arête (E3 5b) *★★***  
The bold rounded arête gives a fine climb with very limited protection.

**6. Suicide Crack (E3 6a) *★★***  
The superb thin crack in the fine wall gives a gem of a route with excellent protection.

**7. J.T.P. (HVS 5a)**  
Poor climbing avoiding an easier alternatives to the right and climbs a prominent jamming and layback crack.

**8. Open Book S**  
The obvious line in the bay gives good climbing but is spoilt by a dubious block at half-height.

**9. Slapalong (VS 4c)**  
Moves rightwards out of Open Book via a ramp to finish on the left-hand side of the arête.

**10. Hell's arête (E4 6a)**  
The rounded arête to the right gives a good line with small hollow holds and limited protection. After a tricky start and difficult moves rightwards the route slowly eases towards the top.

**11. Fall Out (E1 5b) *★★***  
Fine climbing via the fine crack with excellent gear throughout.

**12. Into the Fire (E5 6a) *★***  
A spooky little route taking the faint thin crack on the steeper-than-it-looks wall. Sustained.

**13. A'cheval (VD)**  
The gully is a better descent.

**14. Copper Pinnacle (HS)**  
The crack between the gullies.

**15. Squirm (D)**  
The gully is better as a descent, just.
