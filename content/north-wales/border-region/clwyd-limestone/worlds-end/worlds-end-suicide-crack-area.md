            <p>The next section of cliff is identified by a large detached pillar at its right-hand side. It consists of a number of good little routes dominated by the fine blunt arete of Butter Arete and the thin crack system of Suicide Crack, both minor classics of the escarpment.</p>

            <p><b>1. Margarine Arete (HVS 5a) </b>the rounded arete passing left and back right at mid-height.</p>
            <p><b>2. Whim (HVS 5a) &starf;&starf; </b>fine climbing on a line of flakes and cracks to the right.</p>
            <p><b>3. Windhover (E2 5c) &starf;&starf; </b>a good route. Climb the white groove and wall to gain a steep finger crack. Climb this with a determined approach to good holds at the top.</p>
            <p><b>4. Ivy Groove (VS 4b) </b>climbs cracks and a small corner beginning just right of a small pinnacle in the ground.</p>
            <p><b>5. Butter Arete (E3 5b) &starf;&starf; </b>the bold rounded arete gives a fine climb with very limited protection.</p>
            <p><b>6. Suicide Crack (E3 6a) &starf;&starf; </b>the superb thin crack in the fine wall gives a gem of a route with excellent protection.</p>
            <p><b>7. J.T.P. (HVS 5a) </b>poor climbing avoiding an easier alternatives to the right and climbs a prominent jamming and layback crack.</p>
            <p><b>8. Open Book S </b>the obvious line in the bay gives good climbing but is spoilt by a dubious block at half-height. </p>
            <p><b>9. Slapalong (VS 4c) </b>moves rightwards out of Open Book via a ramp to finish on the left-hand side of the arete.</p>
            <p><b>10. Hell's Arete (E4 6a) </b>the rounded arete to the right gives a good line with small hollow holds and limited protection. After a tricky start and difficult moves rightwards the route slowly eases towards the top.</p>
            <p><b>11. Fall Out (E1 5b) &starf;&starf; </b>fine climbing via the fine crack with excellent gear throughout.</p>
            <p><b>12. Into the Fire (E5 6a) &starf; </b>a spooky little route taking the faint thin crack on the steeper-than-it-looks wall. Sustained. </p>
            <p><b>13. A'cheval (VD) </b>The gully is a better descent.</p>
            <p><b>14. Copper Pinnacle (HS) </b>The crack between the gullies.</p>
            <p><b>15. Squirm (D) </b>The gully is better as a descent, just.</p>
