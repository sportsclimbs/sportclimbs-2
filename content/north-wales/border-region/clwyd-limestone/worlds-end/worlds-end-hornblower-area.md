The first section of cliff reached on the Upper Tier gives a handful of short routes, some being reasonably worthwhile. The easier routes suffer from popularity due to the ease of access and hence can be quite polished.
{.csa}


**1. Hornbeam Wall (VS 4b)**  
A poor route passing a horizontal tree.
{.mt0}

**2. Hornwall (E1 5b)**  
Pleasant climbing on the obvious grey wall.

**3. Horny (E2 5c) *★***  
Difficult moves on glassy rock gain a flake crack leading rightwards to join Hornbeam.

**4. Hornblower (E2 5c) *★***  
The thin crack above the start of Horny. Well protected.

**5. Harvey Wall Banger (E2 5c) *★***  
Takes a direct line through Horny with good climbing on the wall, PR.

**6. Hornbeam (E3 6a) *★***  
Thin and technical climbing gains the finish of Horny via a PR.

**7. Coltsfoot Corner (HS) *★***  
The wall right of the corner gains a ledge from where the main line can be followed more conventionally.

**8. Left Edge (HS)**  
The polished flake and the left-facing flakes above.

**9. Straight Edge (HS)**  
The wall right of Left Edge.

**10. Right Edge (VS 4b)**  
The obvious right-hand flake line.

**11. Coltsfoot Crack (HVS 5a)**  
Pleasant climbing via positive flakes.

**12. Shelfway (S)**  
A rightwards line past a tree gives access to leftwards moves over ledges.

**13. End Flake (HVS)**  
The flake crack right of the tree.

**14. Recession Blues (VS 4c)**  
A short difficult pitch moving left from a ledge to climb the wall.
