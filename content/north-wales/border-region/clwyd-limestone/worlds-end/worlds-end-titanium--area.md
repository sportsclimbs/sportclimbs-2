{.topo .w100}

A fine section of cliff situated just beyond the line of trees. Its grey appearance together with sections of good solid rock give the best E1 on the cliff.

**1. Tripe and Landah (E1 5b)**  
The next crackline past a PR.
{.mt0}

**2. Fossil Finish (VS 4c)**  
A difficult start to reach a thorn bush precedes easier climbing above via a crack.

**3. Ego Beaver (E2 6a) *★***  
A super little route. From the top of a flake move up to a smooth scoop and pas a BR with difficulty to slightly easier climbing past 2PRs.

**4. Titanium Man (E3 6a) *★***  
Again excellent. Follow the wide crack and the thinner crack above to reach a rib, PR. Pass this by difficult moves with more technicalities in the shallow groove, PR.

**5. Crystal (E1 5b) *★★***  
Superb. Climb the rightward-trending crack and thinner crack above finishing left of a ledge and via a short groove.

**6. Dr Technical (E4 6b) *★***  
Follow a shallow groove to the bulge and pass this with difficulty, TR to reach a BR. Move right to better holds and easier climbing via cracks.

**7. Nurse Nurse (E5 6b)**  
Gain the bulge to the right, BR, and pull over using some unsound holds to gain easier ground, TR.

**8. Read My Lips (E5 6c)**  
The final conundrum on this section of wall. Gain a BR in the bulge and pass with difficult to a second BR. Passing this is truly desperate but if success is achieved a good tree lies in wait.
