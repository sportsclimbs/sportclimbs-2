            <p>A fine section of cliff situated just beyond the line of trees. Its grey appearance together with sections of good solid rock give the best E1 on the cliff.</p>

            <p><b>1. Tripe and Landah (E1 5b)</b> the next crackline past a PR. </p>
            <p><b>2. Fossil Finish (VS 4c) </b>a difficult start to reach a thorn bush precedes easier climbing above via a crack.</p>
            <p><b>3. Ego Beaver (E2 6a) * </b>a super little route. From the top of a flake move up to a smooth scoop and pas a BR with difficulty to slightly easier climbing past 2PRs.</p>
            <p><b>4. Titanium Man (E3 6a) * </b>again excellent. Follow the wide crack and the thinner crack above to reach a rib, PR. Pass this by difficult moves with more technicalities in the shallow groove, PR.</p>
            <p><b>5. Crystal (E1 5b) ** </b>Superb. Climb the rightward-trending crack and thinner crack above finishing left of a ledge and via a short groove.</p>
            <p><b>6. Dr Technical (E4 6b) * </b>follow a shallow groove to the bulge and pass this with difficulty, TR to reach a BR. Move right to better holds and easier climbing via cracks.</p>
            <p><b>7. Nurse Nurse (E5 6b) </b>gain the bulge to the right, BR, and pull over using some unsound holds to gain easier ground, TR.</p>
            <p><b>8. Read My Lips (E5 6c) </b>the final conundrum on this section of wall. Gain a BR in the bulge and pass with difficult to a second BR. Passing this is truly desperate but if success is achieved a good tree lies in wait.</p>
