This section of cliff lies beyond an area of grassy ramps and walls of poor rock. A large Ash tree sprouting from cliff gives another strong identifying feature.

**1. Rough Cut (VS 5a)**  
Broken cracks gain a flake. Moves left and up give an awkward exit.

**2. Crystal Ship (E3 5c) *★***  
A technical and worrying experience on the wall to the right via a small overlap.

**3. Dope on a Rope (E5 6a) *★***  
A serious little route gaining the shallow scoop in the smooth-looking wall to finish out of its right-hand side past a PR. This is OK to clip, the rest of the gear is difficult to place.

**4. Dead Fingers Talk (E3 6a) *★***  
Move left from Inelegance to climb to gain a rightwards trending finger crack.

**5. Inelegance (VD) *★★***  
The obvious diagonal line via a series of good flakes.

**6. Inspiration (HS) *★***  
The prominent hand-width crack to the right to join Inelegance.

**7. Incompetence (HVS) *★★***  
The open crackline gives pleasant climbing to a finish on the right.

**8. Insecure (HVS 5a) *★***  
The obvious zig-zag crackline gained from a small ledge. Finish more easily leftwards

**9. Ashgrove (VD)**  
The chimney
