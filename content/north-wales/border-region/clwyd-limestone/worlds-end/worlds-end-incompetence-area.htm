            <p>This section of cliff lies beyond an area of grassy ramps and walls of poor rock. A large Ash tree sprouting from cliff gives another strong identifying feature.</p>

            <p><b>1. Rough Cut (VS 5a) </b>broken cracks gain a flake. Moves left and up give an awkward exit.</p>
            <p><b>2. Crystal Ship (E3 5c) * </b>a technical and worrying experience on the wall to the right via a small overlap.</p>
            <p><b>3. Dope on a Rope (E5 6a) *</b>a serious little route gaining the shallow scoop in the smooth-looking wall to finish out of its right-hand side past a PR. This is OK to clip, the rest of the gear is difficult to place.</p>
            <p><b>4. Dead Fingers Talk (E3 6a) * </b>Move left from Inelegance to climb to gain a rightwards trending finger crack.</p>
            <p><b>5. Inelegance (VD) ** </b>the obvious diagonal line via a series of good flakes.</p>
            <p><b>6. Inspiration (HS) * </b>the prominent hand-width crack to the right to join Inelegance.</p>
            <p><b>7. Incompetence (HVS) ** </b> the open crackline gives pleasant climbing to a finish on the right.</p>
            <p><b>8. Insecure (HVS 5a) * </b>the obvious zig-zag crackline gained from a small ledge. Finish more easily leftwards</p>
            <p><b>9. Ashgrove (VD) </b>the chimney </p>
