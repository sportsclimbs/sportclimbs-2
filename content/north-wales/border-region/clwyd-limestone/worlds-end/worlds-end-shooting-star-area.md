                <p>This is the final section of crag before it turns onto the front face. It gives a fine section of cliff characterised by a prominent white wall of excellent rock bordered on the left by a prominent crackline, the line of Shooting Star.</p>

                <p><b>1. Craznitch Crack (HS)</b> the wide overhanging crack.</p>
                <p><b>2. Close to the Edge (E1 5b) &starf; </b>From 4m up the wide crack to the right, move left to gain a groove leading to the top.</p>
                <p><b>3. Intensity (HVS 5a) &starf;&starf; </b>The classic wide crack gives one of the best routes of the grade on the crag.</p>
                <p><b>4. Gone Bad (E1 5b) </b>the next crackline guarded by a large prickly bush, a bit of a dogged rose, at its foot. </p>
                <p><b>5. Going Bad (E2 5b) </b>the next crackline to the right finishing via some hollow holds on the pillar in the arete.</p>
                <p><b>6. Yew and Me (E3 5c) </b>difficult, fingery and hollow moves cross the bulge to gain a Yew tree and easier climbing above. </p>
                <p><b>7. Cigars of the Pharaohs (7b) &starf; </b>the fingery bulging wall left of the prominent crackline gives a difficult problem easing above the 2nd BR.</p>
                <p><b>8. Shooting Star (E4 6b) &starf;&starf; </b>a classic of the area, packing it in for a relatively short pitch. The obvious rightward-trending crackline gives the line, the bulge and groove above providing the meat of the difficulties.</p>
                <p><b>9. The Final Solution (8a) &starf;&starf; </b>a hard technical exercise with fingery moves low down and an even harder finale.</p>
                <p><b>10. Sisters of the Moon (E5 6a) </b>something of a non-route attempting the climb the wall to the right but usually using holds in the next route.</p>
                <p><b>11. Brigadier Gerard (E5 6a) &starf; </b>the vague and faint crackline on the right-hand side of the wall gives a challenging experience given the nature of the rock and protection, PR.</p>
