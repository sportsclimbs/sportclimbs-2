This is the final section of crag before it turns onto the front face. It gives a fine section of cliff characterised by a prominent white wall of excellent rock bordered on the left by a prominent crackline, the line of Shooting Star.

**1. Craznitch Crack (HS)**  
The wide overhanging crack.
{.mt0}

**2. Close to the Edge (E1 5b) *★***  
From 4m up the wide crack to the right, move left to gain a groove leading to the top.

**3. Intensity (HVS 5a) *★★***  
The classic wide crack gives one of the best routes of the grade on the crag.

**4. Gone Bad (E1 5b)**  
The next crackline guarded by a large prickly bush, a bit of a dogged rose, at its foot.

**5. Going Bad (E2 5b)**  
The next crackline to the right finishing via some hollow holds on the pillar in the arête.

**6. Yew and Me (E3 5c)**  
Difficult, fingery and hollow moves cross the bulge to gain a Yew tree and easier climbing above.

**7. Cigars of the Pharaohs (7b) *★***  
The fingery bulging wall left of the prominent crackline gives a difficult problem easing above the 2nd BR.

**8. Shooting Star (E4 6b) *★★***  
A classic of the area, packing it in for a relatively short pitch. The obvious rightward-trending crackline gives the line, the bulge and groove above providing the meat of the difficulties.

**9. The Final Solution (8a) *★★***  
A hard technical exercise with fingery moves low down and an even harder finale.

**10. Sisters of the Moon (E5 6a)**  
Something of a non-route attempting the climb the wall to the right but usually using holds in the next route.

**11. Brigadier Gerard (E5 6a) *★***  
The vague and faint crackline on the right-hand side of the wall gives a challenging experience given the nature of the rock and protection, PR.
