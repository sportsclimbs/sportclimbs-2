This is the impressively situated area of cliff just as you turn the corner from Shooting Star Area. A superb section of crag complete with the crag's classic E2 and a number of harder and more technical routes with some situ gear.

**1. Telegram Sam (E4 6a) *★***  
Pleasant and intricate climbing on the left-hand side of the next wall via a BR. Finish via an obvious crack.

**2. Taerg Wall (E2 5c) *★★***  
The classic of the wall taking the centre of the wall via a short crack to get established on a ledge. Moving right and up via a PR provides the crux.

**3. Wasters mall (E4 6b) *★★***  
Tackles the wall to the right in a fine position. Move up to a small undercut flake, then move left and up, PR, via a hard move to reach a good flake. Finish with relief slightly leftwards.

**4. Heart of Darkness (E3 5c) *★***  
Good positions and open climbing on the right-hand arête of the wall.

**5. Half and Half (HS)**  
The horrible chimney. Half climb, half grotto.

**6. Sleeping Beauty (E3 6a)**  
The steep wall to the right of the cave, PR, leads with difficulty leads to easier climbing above.

**7. Xuxu (E2 5b)**  
hard moves thorough the horribly hollow bulge to the right leads to easier climbing above.

**8. Slither (VS 4c) *★***  
The thin crack branching left out of the wider crack.

**9. Ivy Crack (HS) *★***  
The wider crack gives a classic old-fashioned climb

**10. Wither (D)**  
The wider crack complete with loads-a-chocks

**11. Christmas Spirit (E1 5b)**  
The finger crack in the left-hand side of the next wall finishing via hollow flakes.

**12. Flash Harry (E5 6b) *★***  
The wall to the right gives a difficult offering via a thin crack, overlap, PR, and hard moves to finally finish leftwards.

**13. Flash Dance (E4 6b) *★★***  
Technical face climbing via the thin crack in the right-hand side of the wall. 2PRS.

**14. Jumping Jack Flash (E4 5c)**  
Breaks right of Flash Dance to climb the wall via a hollow flake, TR.
