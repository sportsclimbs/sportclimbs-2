            <p>The final section of the upper tier beyond Taerg Wall gives good rock and a handful of good routes most especially World's Edge and Finer Feelings.</p>

            <p><b>1. Cathcart's Got a Brand New Brodrie (E1 5b) </b>From behind a small tree tackles a small overlap to reach a thin crack leading to the top. </p>
            <p><b>2. Finer Feelings (HVS 5a) ** </b>The pleasant wall starting 5m right of the tree.</p>
            <p><b>3. Warp Commander (E1 5b) * </b>Climbs the next wall via a small overlap, PR, and pleasant wall above past a second PR.</p>
            <p><b>4. The Trick (HVS 5a) </b>the obvious crack finishing the wall and crack above with a little more difficulty.</p>
            <p><b>5. Vertical Games (E3 6a) * </b>A super little route gaining the prominent flake crack and finding all the difficulties where it ends. Well protected.</p>
            <p><b>6. Chance (E2 5b) </b>A poor route on hollow flakes on the wall to the right to finish via a thin crack and better rock.</p>
            <p><b>7. Ash Bole (S) </b>The horrible crackline.</p>
            <p><b>8. Quill (VS 4b) </b>The obvious jamming crack and more awkward crack above, just left of the descent path gives a better route.</p>
            <p><b>9. Sting (HS) </b>* Another good route taking a prominent flake and wide crack above right of the descent gully. </p>
            <p><b>10. Jennifer Crack (HS) * </b>the obvious wide crack taking the full height of the crag.</p>
            <p><b>11. World's Edge (E4 6a) ** </b>Superb positions and climbing. Tackles the main arete to the right starting on its right-hand side to reach a bulge. The difficulties here are relatively short and reasonably protectable to reach a PR and easier climbing above.</p>
            <p><b>12. Someone Like You (E5 6b) * </b>The centre of the wall requires a l-o-n-g reach above the mid height PR. Precarious low down, PR.</p>
            <p><b>13. Soul on Ice (E4 5c) </b>The right-hand side of the wall via a number of hollow flakes on the rib with the trickiest move by a TR that has passed it sell-by date. A thin crack finishes the route.</p>
