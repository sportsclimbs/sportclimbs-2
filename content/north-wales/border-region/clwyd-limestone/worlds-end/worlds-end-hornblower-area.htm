            <p>The first section of cliff reached on the Upper Tier gives a handful of short routes, some being reasonably worthwhile. The easier routes suffer from popularity due to the ease of access and hence can be quite polished.</p>

            <p><b>1. Hornbeam Wall (VS 4b) </b>a poor route passing a horizontal tree.</p>
            <p><b>2. Hornwall (E1 5b) </b>pleasant climbing on the obvious grey wall. </p>
            <p><b>3. Horny (E2 5c) *</b> difficult moves on glassy rock gain a flake crack leading rightwards to join Hornbeam.</p>
            <p><b>4. Hornblower (E2 5c) * </b>the thin crack above the start of Horny. Well protected.</p>
            <p><b>5. Harvey Wall Banger (E2 5c) * </b>takes a direct line through Horny with good climbing on the wall, PR.</p>
            <p><b>6. Hornbeam (E3 6a) * </b>thin and technical climbing gains the finish of Horny via a PR.</p>
            <p><b>7. Coltsfoot Corner (HS) * </b>the wall right of the corner gains a ledge from where the main line can be followed more conventionally.</p>
            <p><b>8. Left Edge (HS) </b>The polished flake and the left-facing flakes above.</p>
            <p><b>9. Straight Edge (HS) </b>the wall right of Left Edge.</p>
            <p><b>10. Right Edge (VS 4b) </b>the obvious right-hand flake line.</p>
            <p><b>11. Coltsfoot Crack (HVS 5a) </b>pleasant climbing via positive flakes.</p>
            <p><b>12. Shelfway (S)</b>a rightwards line past a tree gives access to leftwards moves over ledges.</p>
            <p><b>13. End Flake (HVS) </b>the flake crack right of the tree.</p>
            <p><b>14. Recession Blues (VS 4c) </b>A short difficult pitch moving left from a ledge to climb the wall.</p>
