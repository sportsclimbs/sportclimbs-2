**2. Ashgrove Prelims (VS 4c) *★***  
The orange groove and layback crack.

The slabby wall and thin cracks to its left give a tricky pitch.

**4 Black Path (E2 5b)**  
The centre of the wall with little in the way of gear.

The wall and crack from the top of the left-hand of two pinnacles.

**6. Gardener's Question Time(S)**  
The grotty groove above the right-hand pedestal

The obvious poor groove.

The leftwards crack system

Pleasant climbing with a layback start.

**14. Shabby Slab (E1 5a) *★***
