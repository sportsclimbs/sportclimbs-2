The wall and scoop gained from Ashgrove Prelims.
{.mt0}

**2. Ashgrove Prelims (VS 4c) *★***  
The orange groove and layback crack.

**3. Black Ash (HVS 5b)**  
The slabby wall and thin cracks to its left give a tricky pitch.

**4 Black Path (E2 5b)**  
The centre of the wall with little in the way of gear.

**5. Flakeless Groove (HS)**  
The wall and crack from the top of the left-hand of two pinnacles.

**6. Gardener's Question Time(S)**  
The grotty groove above the right-hand pedestal

**7. Scarface Groove (D)**  
The obvious poor groove.

**8. White Crack (VD)**  
The leftwards crack system

**9. Rich's Robbery (S)**  
The black wall

The left-trending crack

**11. Twisting Corner (HS)**

**12. Bootlace Thread (E5 6a) *★***  
A minor gem. From 2m up Twisting Corner, move right onto the wall and climb positively, directly and quickly to claim the pitch.

**13. Cornucopia (HVS 5a) *★***  
Pleasant climbing with a layback start.

**14. Shabby Slab (E1 5a) *★***  
Pleasant climbing with an airy start on good rock with an insecure feel to it.

The crack.
