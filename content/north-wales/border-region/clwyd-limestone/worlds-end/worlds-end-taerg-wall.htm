            <p>This is the impressively situated area of cliff just as you turn the corner from Shooting Star Area. A superb section of crag complete with the crag's classic E2 and a number of harder and more technical routes with some situ gear.</p>

            <p><b>1. Telegram Sam (E4 6a) * </b>Pleasant and intricate climbing on the left-hand side of the next wall via a BR. Finish via an obvious crack.</p>
            <p><b>2. Taerg Wall (E2 5c) ** </b>the classic of the wall taking the centre of the wall via a short crack to get established on a ledge. Moving right and up via a PR provides the crux.</p>
            <p><b>3. Wasters mall (E4 6b) ** </b>Tackles the wall to the right in a fine position. Move up to a small undercut flake, then move left and up, PR, via a hard move to reach a good flake. Finish with relief slightly leftwards.</p>
            <p><b>4. Heart of Darkness (E3 5c) * </b>Good positions and open climbing on the right-hand arete of the wall. </p>
            <p><b>5. Half and Half (HS) </b>The horrible chimney. Half climb, half grotto.</p>
            <p><b>6. Sleeping Beauty (E3 6a) </b>the steep wall to the right of the cave, PR, leads with difficulty leads to easier climbing above.</p>
            <p><b>7. Xuxu (E2 5b) </b>hard moves thorough the horribly hollow bulge to the right leads to easier climbing above. </p>
            <p><b>8. Slither (VS 4c) * </b>The thin crack branching left out of the wider crack.</p>
            <p><b>9. Ivy Crack (HS) * </b>the wider crack gives a classic old-fashioned climb</p>
            <p><b>10. Wither (D) </b>the wider crack complete with loads-a-chocks</p>
            <p><b>11. Christmas Spirit (E1 5b) </b>the finger crack in the left-hand side of the next wall finishing via hollow flakes.</p>
            <p><b>12. Flash Harry (E5 6b) * </b>the wall to the right gives a difficult offering via a thin crack, overlap, PR, and hard moves to finally finish leftwards.</p>
            <p><b>13. Flash Dance (E4 6b) ** </b> technical face climbing via the thin crack in the right-hand side of the wall. 2PRS.</p>
            <p><b>14. Jumping Jack Flash (E4 5c) </b>breaks right of Flash Dance to climb the wall via a hollow flake, TR.</p>
