The final section of the upper tier beyond Taerg Wall gives good rock and a handful of good routes most especially World's Edge and Finer Feelings.

**1. Cathcart's Got a Brand New Brodrie (E1 5b)**  
From behind a small tree tackles a small overlap to reach a thin crack leading to the top.

**2. Finer Feelings (HVS 5a) *★★***  
The pleasant wall starting 5m right of the tree.

**3. Warp Commander (E1 5b) *★***  
Climbs the next wall via a small overlap, PR, and pleasant wall above past a second PR.

**4. The Trick (HVS 5a)**  
The obvious crack finishing the wall and crack above with a little more difficulty.

**5. Vertical Games (E3 6a) *★***  
A super little route gaining the prominent flake crack and finding all the difficulties where it ends. Well protected.

**6. Chance (E2 5b)**  
A poor route on hollow flakes on the wall to the right to finish via a thin crack and better rock.

**7. Ash Bole (S)**  
The horrible crackline.

**8. Quill (VS 4b)**  
The obvious jamming crack and more awkward crack above, just left of the descent path gives a better route.

**9. Sting (HS) *★***  
Another good route taking a prominent flake and wide crack above right of the descent gully.

**10. Jennifer Crack (HS) *★***  
The obvious wide crack taking the full height of the crag.

**11. World's Edge (E4 6a) *★★***  
Superb positions and climbing. Tackles the main arête to the right starting on its right-hand side to reach a bulge. The difficulties here are relatively short and reasonably protectable to reach a PR and easier climbing above.

**12. Someone Like You (E5 6b) *★***  
The centre of the wall requires a l-o-n-g reach above the mid height PR. Precarious low down, PR.

**13. Soul on Ice (E4 5c)**  
The right-hand side of the wall via a number of hollow flakes on the rib with the trickiest move by a TR that has passed it sell-by date. A thin crack finishes the route.
