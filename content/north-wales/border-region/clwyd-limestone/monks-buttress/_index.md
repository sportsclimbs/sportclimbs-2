## Situation

This crag stands in an impressive position on the right-hand flank of Pinfold Valley. It is clearly visible overlooking the parking place for those crags.

## Approach

The best approach is from the Pinfold Valley. Take the long path up the gully to Pinfold South. Turn right below Monkshead Buttress and follow the path across the hillside to reach the buttress.

## Character

A very underrated little crag with a number of excellent pitches. There are a mixture of trad and sport pitches and most of the latter now have suitable lower-off stations.

The crag faces northwest, receives only evening sun but is an ideal warm weather or evening venue. Avoid if windy.
