            <p><b>1. Extreme Ways (7c) ** </b> After the roof of Dr Gonzo, follows the lip of the overlaps leftwards. Superb.</p>
            <p><b>2. Project</b> The impressive ivy roof and wall and prow above.</p>
            <p><b>3. Misty Vision (E6 6b) **</b> Right-hand finish to the Fog via overlap.</p>
            <p><b>4. The Fog (E6 6b) ***</b> The striking thin crackline gives a classic, sustained pitch.</p>
            <p><b>5. Gwennan (8a+) * </b>the desperately fingery wall left again.</p>
            <p><b>6. Fine Feathered Fink (7b+) *</b> Fingery lower wall slightly rightwards, then up onto headwall.</p>
            <p><b>6a. Ring Piece (7b) </b>intense moves through lower overlaps and much easier above.</p>
            <p><b>7. Sticky Toffee (6c+) * </b>A boulder problem start and leftwards line up the compact wall.</p>
            <p><b>8. Cured (7b+) ** </b>very technical moves onto scooped upper wall.</p>
            <p><b>9. Train to Hell (7c) ** </b>very technical sequence into shallow scoop. Fingery!</p>
            <p><b>10. Line of Fire (E5 6a) * </b>the bold antithesis of nearby routes.</p>
            <p><b>11. Bolt from the Blue (E6 6c) ** </b>desperate moves past the bolt onto the upper face.</p>
            <p><b>12. Back in the Black (7c) *** </b>brilliant face climbing leftwards from Bolt.</p>
            <p><b>13. Elite Syncopations (8a) ** </b>the desperately fingery direct start.</p>
            <p><b>14. Punishment of Luxury (E4 6b) ** </b>powerful moves up the 'threaded' crackline.</p>
            <p><b>15. It's Yours (7b+) * </b>through roof and then leftwards onto the face.</p>
            <p><b>The Sound and the Fury (8b) *</b> the desperate overhang and wall to the left.</p>
