            <p><b>1. Locomotion (E5 6b) </b>The right arete of the corner gained via the overlap. Originally BRs, now side runner!</p>
            <p><b>2. Gemma's World Direct (E3 5c) </b>The right wall of the prominent corner with PRs and TRs.</p>
            <p><b>3. Alison (E1 5b) * </b>The large open corner gained from flake on left wall. Direct start is E4 6b.</p>
            <p><b>4. Dreadlocks (7a+) ** </b>Straight up from initial flake on 'rinklets' to difficult mantelshelf of Climb High.</p>
            <p><b>5. Climb High (7a) ** </b>The classic shallow groove in centre of wall. Hard mantelshelf finale.</p>
            <p><b>6. Do Walls have Ears (7a+) * </b>Right-hand branch off Traction Trauma to climb upper wall direct. Fingery.</p>
            <p><b>7. Traction Trauma (E4 6a) ** </b>Superb technical face on left-hand side of wall. Just enough fixed pro.</p>
            <p><b>8. In Search of Someone Silly (E5 6b) * </b>Intricate line with tricky wall, fingery slab and hard leftwards exit.</p>
            <p><b>9. Walking with Barrance (7b+) * </b>Excellent. Ramp, fingery wall and tricky finishing bulge.</p>
            <p><b>10. Technicolour Yawn (7a+) ** </b>Another classic. The right-hand of two cracklines gives a sustained pitch.</p>
            <p><b>11. I Punched Judy First (7b) * </b>The left-hand line gives a pumpier pitch.</p>
            <p><b>12. When Saturday Comes (7c+) * </b>Desperate wall climbing saving its crux till last.</p>
            <p><b>13. Broken Dreams (7c) ** </b>Another classic. Hard fingery face onto flake with flourishing overlap to finish.</p>
            <p><b>14. Insomnia (8b) ***</b> desperate line left of Broken Dreams, starting separately.</p>
            <p><b>Counting Sheep (8a+) ** </b>climbs leftwards from the start via a tooth-shaped undercut from where it apparently becomes easier.</p>
            <p><b>15. Flowers are for the Dead (7c) * </b>The final hard route taking a fingery bulge to a tricky finale</p>
