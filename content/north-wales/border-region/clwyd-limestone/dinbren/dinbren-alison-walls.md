**1. Locomotion (E5 6b)**  
The right arête of the corner gained via the overlap. Originally BRs, now side runner!

**2. Gemma's World Direct (E3 5c)**  
The right wall of the prominent corner with PRs and TRs.

**3. Alison (E1 5b) *★***  
The large open corner gained from flake on left wall. Direct start is E4 6b.

**4. Dreadlocks (7a+) *★★***  
Straight up from initial flake on 'rinklets' to difficult mantelshelf of Climb High.

**5. Climb High (7a) *★★***  
The classic shallow groove in centre of wall. Hard mantelshelf finale.

**6. Do Walls have Ears (7a+) *★***  
Right-hand branch off Traction Trauma to climb upper wall direct. Fingery.

**7. Traction Trauma (E4 6a) *★★***  
Superb technical face on left-hand side of wall. Just enough fixed pro.

**8. In Search of Someone Silly (E5 6b) *★***  
Intricate line with tricky wall, fingery slab and hard leftwards exit.

**9. Walking with Barrance (7b+) *★***  
Excellent. Ramp, fingery wall and tricky finishing bulge.

**10. Technicolour Yawn (7a+) *★★***  
Another classic. The right-hand of two cracklines gives a sustained pitch.

**11. I Punched Judy First (7b) *★***  
The left-hand line gives a pumpier pitch.

**12. When Saturday Comes (7c+) *★***  
Desperate wall climbing saving its crux till last.

**13. Broken Dreams (7c) *★★***  
Another classic. Hard fingery face onto flake with flourishing overlap to finish.

**14. Insomnia (8b) *★★★***  
Desperate line left of Broken Dreams, starting separately.

**Counting Sheep (8a+) *★★***  
climbs leftwards from the start via a tooth-shaped undercut from where it apparently becomes easier.

**15. Flowers are for the Dead (7c) *★***  
The final hard route taking a fingery bulge to a tricky finale
