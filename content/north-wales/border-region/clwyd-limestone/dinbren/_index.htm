    The best approach is from Llangollen. Cross the bridge over the river Dee from the A5 and turn right. Take the first left on this road and follow it over the canal bridge and onto Dinbren Road. Follow this for 2km until a T junction is reach - the crags can be seen above.</p>

<p>Turn right and follow the road over a cattle grid until a prominent layby can be located on the left after 300m. Park here.</p>

<p>A path above the layby skirts up to the left and into the vague gully. This rises to meet the crag at the junction of its two walls.</p>
