            <p>These are the walls at the far end of the escarpment and are identified by the DM graffiti at their base. There are two sectors and are described from left to right beginning with the 'DM' walls.</p>

            <p><b>5. Sgrech yr Hebog (5+) &starf; </b>the next shallow groove right of the graffiti leads to the break. Easier above.</p>
