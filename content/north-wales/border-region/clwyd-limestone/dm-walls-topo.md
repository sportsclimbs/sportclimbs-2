PLEASE NOTE: There is a voluntary bird ban on this section of cliff due to nesting Peregrine Flacons. This lasts from 15th February until 15th July.

These are the walls at the far end of the escarpment and are identified by the DM graffiti at their base. There are two sectors and are described from left to right beginning with the 'DM' walls.
