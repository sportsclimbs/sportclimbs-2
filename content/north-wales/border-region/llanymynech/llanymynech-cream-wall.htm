            <p><b>1. Better Lait than Never (6b) * </b>the overhanging arete gives fine move.</p>
            <p><b>2. Cream HVS 5a </b>a long ambling route with plenty of loose rock. From the top of the crack either traverse right to a BB or continue up and then left to the arete above the void and finish up the walls above.</p>
            <p><b>3. Screaming Dream (6a+) </b>Pleasant face climbing with a thuggy bulging start</p>
            <p><b>4. Semi Skimmed (6a+) </b>short steep wall followed by easy ground and technical moves and long reach to belay</p>
            <p><b>5. Gold Top (6b) </b>easy start then left-hand line of bolts with pleasant technicalities</p>
            <p><b>6. All gone Sour (6b) * </b>takes right-hand branch of bolts. Technical low down with plenty of climbing above</p>
            <p><b>7. The Cat that Got the Cream (6b+) * </b>from behind tree climbs scoop and walls to ledge with fine headwall as finale.</p>
            <p><b>8. Past You Eyes (6b+) **</b> fine central line of wall with plenty of pleasant climb throughout. Take care with hollow blocks at finale.<span class="new"> DO NOT CLIMB. Top has fallen down.</span></p>
            <p><b>9. UHT (6b) * </b>branches off right from 4th bolt to reach easier ground and hanging groove above overlaps.</p>
            <p><b>10. Never Rub Another Man's Rhubarb (6b) * </b>Counter line to UHT with ledgey start then excellent climbing culminating in a fine bulging finale on good holds</p>
