            <p>There are two routes right of the mains section of wall gained by scrambling up onto a higher ledge system.</p>
            <p><b>49 and Counting (6a) * </b>is the right-hand line and <b>Coming of Age (6a)</b> the left-hand.</p>
            <p><b>1. Bah, Bah Black Sheep (6a+) </b>easier line on right-hand side of wall. Start at slightly higher ledge system.</p>
            <p><b>2. Up the Spout (6b) * </b>good and straightforward climbing to a tricky final/reach directly above the last BR. Now extended up arete above ledge.</p>
            <p><b>3. Humpty Dumpty (6c+) </b>** Pleasant face climbing squeezed onto the very right-hand edge of the wall. Easy start to open face via faint crack high up.</p>
            <p><b>4. Hickory Dickory Dock (7a) **</b> Better on the upper wall. Easy ground to ledge. Difficult moves through right-hand of slim overlap, then thin crack to the top. </p>
            <p><b>5. Incy Wincy Spider (7a+) **</b> Right-hand of two hard routes through overlap demarcated by a BR on the lip. Hard moves to and through the overlap. Steadier above. 70m required.</p>
            <p><b>6. Pew, Pew, Barney, McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Grub (7a+) ** </b>Left-hand through overlap and again excellent. A long reach to and through the overlap helps. 70m rope required.</p>
            <p><b>7. Grid Iron (6c) **</b> Original of wall and still its best? Centre of lower wall, then face with zig zag crack and excellent wall above. 70m required.</p>
            <p><b>8. Curfew (6b+) ** </b>Superb sustained face climbing from just left of Grid Iron at half-height. 70m required.</p>
            <p><b>9. A Night Torchlight Parade (6b+) ** </b>new direct line taking lower wall to ledge and fine upper wall. Can be used to start: 70m required.</p>
            <p><b>10. Gaza Stripper (6b) ** </b>thin crack system from half-height ledge. Excellent climbing, gained by the lower half taken by The Stringlers 70m required.</p>
            <p><b>11. The Stringlers (6a) </b>straightforward climbing up the open corner/groove line</p>
            <p><b>12. A Night on the Town (6c+</b>) wall to left from the same half-height ledge. Good climbing but only as a last resort when you've ticked everything. New start added on lower wall. 70m required.</p>
            <p><b>13. Sack the Strugglers (6c) * </b>pleasant climbing via a blunt, tricky rib and easier overlaps.</p>
            <p><b> 14. Smack the Juggler (6b+) *</b>Right-hand side of wall via thin crack to ledge. Face on left with tricky finish. <span class="new">Has a new extension finish via the wall and arete at the same grade</span></p>
            <p><b>15. Jack the Smuggler (6c+) *</b> Centre of wall by technical moves from half-height. Sustained and excellent. <span class="new">Rebolted to give a safer proposition</span></p>
            <p><b>16. Strawberry Tubin (7a+) * </b>a long fine route with some hard moves just below half-height and fingery throughout. Unfortunately has a poor start.</p>
