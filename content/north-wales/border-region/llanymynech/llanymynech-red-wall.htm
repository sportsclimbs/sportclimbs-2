            <p><img src="/img/north-wales/border-region/llanymynech/Red-LH-copy.jpg" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="600"><b>1. Crab Stick (6c) &starf;</b> Just right of arete of wall. Sustained climbing finishing rightwards from the fifth BR. </p>
            <p><b>2. Lobster on the Loose (7a) &starf;</b> Tricky mantelshelf start. Wall to difficult ramp and steep finish. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>3. Rapture of the Deep (7a) &starf;&starf; </b>Through overlap and technical wall to left side of slab. Slim sustained groove exiting right to belay. <span class="new">Rebolted</span></p>
            <p><b>4. Subterranean Sidewalk (6c+) &starf;&starf; </b>Short arete to start then wall to right-hand side of slab. Vague arete to belay. Airy climbing, sustained but with the crux by the second BR. </p>
            <p><b>5. Dead Man's Fingers (6c+) &starf;&starf;</b> Slightly down slope. Superb sustained climbing. <span class="new">New finale added through bulges on right to give an airy finish.</span></p>
            <p><b>6. The Ancient Mariner (7a)</b> &starf;&starf;&starf; Climbs to the top of the wall. A superb route with hard moves at half-height and an 'out there' finish. 70m rope gets you back to the ground. </p>
            <p><b>7. Shipperdy Doo-Dah (7a) &starf; </b>Climbs straight with hard moves over overlap and difficult finale. </p>
            <p><b>8. The Deep (6c+) &starf;</b> Lower down again. From ledges at 5m climb direct to the via half-height slab BB. 60m rope required. </p>
            <p><b>9. I Saw Three Ships (6c+) &starf;&starf; </b>Fine direct pitch to two-thirds height belay. Excellent sustained climbing. 60m rope gets you back down. </p>

            <p><b>10. Ship Dip (6c+) &starf;&starf;</b> Direct line with tricky lower wall aiming for shallow groove high up. Superb. 60m rope gets you back down. </p>
            <p><b>11. Mussel Bound (7a) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> At bottom of slop, left of main corner. Left-hand of two grooves then direct line up impending wall. Brilliant and high in grade. 60m rope gets you back down. </p>
            <p><b>12. Long John Codling (7a) &starf;&starf; </b>Right-hand of two grooves then wall above. Difficult moves, then leftwards and up to belay. <span class="new">Retrobolted</span></p>
            <p><b>13. Dead Man's Chest (7a) &starf;&starf;</b> superb diagonal of wall requiring 18 quick-draws and an 80. Superb climbing but best done on a quiet day.</p>
            <p><b>Clematis (6b+) </b>the long corner line has now been bolted. Needs some traffic. <span class="new">Retrobolted</span></p>
            <p><b>Poison Ivy (7a) &starf;&starf; </b>the slim side wall right of the corner gives a superb wall pitch with the difficulties just above the 4th BR. <span class="new">Retrobolted and new belay added.</span></p>
            <p><b>The Day of the Triffids (6b+) &starf; </b>the right arete of the wall, mainly on its left-hand side. </p>
