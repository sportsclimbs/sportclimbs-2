## Approach

Take any route onto the A483 Oswestry to Welshpool road. Follow this south (or north) to the village of Pant. At the southern end of the village the quarry will clearly be seen. Take Underhill Lane which leads in 300m to a parking area by a gate. This gate gives access to a track into and around the quarry. As you walk from the car park to the crag you'll be crossing over from England into Wales.


### Parking

There has been the odd instance of break-ins at the parking area. For this reason leave nothing on display in you car or park in the village and walk in.
