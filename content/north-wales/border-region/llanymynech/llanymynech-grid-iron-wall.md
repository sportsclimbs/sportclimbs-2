There are two routes right of the main section of wall gained by scrambling up onto a higher ledge system.

**49 and Counting (6a) *★***  
Is the right-hand line and **Coming of Age (6a)** the left-hand.
{.mt0}

**1. Bah, Bah Black Sheep (6a+)**  
Easier line on right-hand side of wall. Start at slightly higher ledge system.

**2. Up the Spout (6b) *★***  
Good and straightforward climbing to a tricky final/reach directly above the last BR. Now extended up arête above ledge.

**3. Humpty Dumpty (6c+) *★★***  
Pleasant face climbing squeezed onto the very right-hand edge of the wall. Easy start to open face via faint crack high up.

**4. Hickory Dickory Dock (7a) *★★***  
Better on the upper wall. Easy ground to ledge. Difficult moves through right-hand of slim overlap, then thin crack to the top.

**5. Incy Wincy Spider (7a+) *★★***  
Right-hand of two hard routes through overlap demarcated by a BR on the lip. Hard moves to and through the overlap. Steadier above. 70m required.

**6. Pew, Pew, Barney, McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Grub (7a+) *★★***  
Left-hand through overlap and again excellent. A long reach to and through the overlap helps. 70m rope required.

**7. Grid Iron (6c) *★★***  
Original of wall and still its best? Centre of lower wall, then face with zig zag crack and excellent wall above. 70m required.

**8. Curfew (6b+) *★★***  
Superb sustained face climbing from just left of Grid Iron at half-height. 70m required.

**9. A Night Torchlight Parade (6b+) *★★***  
New direct line taking lower wall to ledge and fine upper wall. Can be used to start: 70m required.

**10. Gaza Stripper (6b) *★★***  
Thin crack system from half-height ledge. Excellent climbing, gained by the lower half taken by The Stringlers 70m required.

**11. The Stringlers (6a)**  
Straightforward climbing up the open corner/groove line.

**12. A Night on the Town (6c+)**  
The wall to the left from the same half-height ledge. Good climbing but only as a last resort when you've ticked everything. New start added on lower wall. 70m required.

**13. Sack the Strugglers (6c) *★***  
Pleasant climbing via a blunt, tricky rib and easier overlaps.

**14. Smack the Juggler (6b+) *★***  
The right-hand side of wall via thin crack to ledge. Face on left with tricky finish. Has a new extension finish via the wall and arête at the same grade.

**15. Jack the Smuggler (6c+) *★***  
Centre of wall by technical moves from half-height. Sustained and excellent. Rebolted to give a safer proposition.

**16. Strawberry Tubin (7a+) *★***  
A long fine route with some hard moves just below half-height and fingery throughout. Unfortunately has a poor start.
