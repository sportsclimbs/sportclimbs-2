**1. Crab Stick (6c) *★***  
Just right of arête of wall. Sustained climbing finishing rightwards from the fifth BR.

**2. Lobster on the Loose (7a) *★***  
Tricky mantelshelf start. Wall to difficult ramp and steep finish. Rebolted

**3. Rapture of the Deep (7a) *★★***  
Through overlap and technical wall to left side of slab. Slim sustained groove exiting right to belay. Rebolted

**4. Subterranean Sidewalk (6c+) *★★***  
Short arête to start then wall to right-hand side of slab. Vague arête to belay. Airy climbing, sustained but with the crux by the second BR.

**5. Dead Man's Fingers (6c+) *★★***  
Slightly down slope. Superb sustained climbing. New finale added through bulges on right to give an airy finish.

**6. The Ancient Mariner (7a) *★★★***  
Climbs to the top of the wall. A superb route with hard moves at half-height and an 'out there' finish. 70m rope gets you back to the ground.

**7. Shipperdy Doo-Dah (7a) *★***  
Climbs straight with hard moves over overlap and difficult finale.

**8. The Deep (6c+) *★***  
Lower down again. From ledges at 5m climb direct to the via half-height slab BB. 60m rope required.

**9. I Saw Three Ships (6c+) *★★***  
Fine direct pitch to two-thirds height belay. Excellent sustained climbing. 60m rope gets you back down.


**10. Ship Dip (6c+) *★★***  
Direct line with tricky lower wall aiming for shallow groove high up. Superb. 60m rope gets you back down.

**11. Mussel Bound (7a) *★★★***  
At bottom of slop, left of main corner. Left-hand of two grooves then direct line up impending wall. Brilliant and high in grade. 60m rope gets you back down.

**12. Long John Codling (7a) *★★***  
Right-hand of two grooves then wall above. Difficult moves, then leftwards and up to belay. Retrobolted

**13. Dead Man's Chest (7a) *★★***  
Superb diagonal of wall requiring 18 quick-draws and an 80. Superb climbing but best done on a quiet day.

**Clematis (6b+)**  
The long corner line has now been bolted. Needs some traffic. Retrobolted

**Poison Ivy (7a) *★★***  
The slim side wall right of the corner gives a superb wall pitch with the difficulties just above the 4th BR. Retrobolted and new belay added.

**The Day of the Triffids (6b+) *★***  
The right arête of the wall, mainly on its left-hand side.
