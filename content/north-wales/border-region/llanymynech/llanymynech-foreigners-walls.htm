<div class="alert notopmargin boldcaps">Please note that a number of routes have had their bolt runners removed on this wall by the Shropshire Wildlife Trust. The reason is that a number of rare plants exist below the wall and so they do not want climbing here. All the routes where bolts have been removed are marked accordingly.</div>
