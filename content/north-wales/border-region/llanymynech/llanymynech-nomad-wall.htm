            <p>The superb slim wall set at a higher level gives a trio of the best routes in the quarry. All give fantastic wall climbing with a limited amount of fixed gear. Take a full trad rack including a couple of medium sized Friends and a broad selection of wires.</p>

            <p>To reach the wall, climb the lower arete on its right-hand side before transferring onto a ledge below the main section of wall</p>

            <p><b>1. Rabble Rouser (6b+)&starf; </b>the right-hand side of the wall, using the arete in many places, gives a fine introduction to the wall. The main difficulties lie in the first 10m. <span class="new">Now bolted</span></p>
            <p><b>2. This Won't Hurt (7a) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> the easiest route of the three climbs the wall 5m left of the right-hand arete. Tricky moves low down but the route as a whole provides a fine sustained effort. <span class="new">Now bolted</span> <a href="This-Wont-Hurt.htm">Photo. </a></p>
            <p><b>3. Unbroken (7a) &starf;&starf;&starf; </b>an impressive pitch tackling the centre of the smoothest section of the wall and saves its hardest section to the final 10m. Fingery and superb.</p>
            <p><b>4. Nomad (7a+) &starf;&starf;&starf;</b> the magnificent central line of the wall gives a memorable pitch. Totally direct and absorbing with the crux in the final 8m. <span class="new">Now bolted</span></p>
            <p><b>5. The Screaming Skull (7b)</b> &starf;&starf;&starf; the left-hand line of the wall now climbed with a direct start and bolted. One very short hard section with an 'energetic' finale. Brilliant <span class="new">Now bolted</span></p>

            <p><b>6. Dentine (5+) </b>right-hand side of lower wall.</p>
            <p><b>7. Pull 'em Out (6a) </b>next route in.</p>
            <p><b>8. Root Treatment (6c) &starf; </b>central line with best moves on the wall. Tough Finale.</p>
            <p><b>9. Another Filling (6b+) </b>left-hand line. </p>
            <p>The large expanse of wall to the left of this sports one enormous sport route <b>Southern Mountains 6a &starf;. </b>The routes is 50m in length with two lower-offs. 17 clips.</p>
