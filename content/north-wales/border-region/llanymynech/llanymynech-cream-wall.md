**1. Better Lait than Never (6b) *★***  
The overhanging arête gives fine move.

**2. Cream HVS 5a**  
A long ambling route with plenty of loose rock. From the top of the crack either traverse right to a BB or continue up and then left to the arête above the void and finish up the walls above.

**3. Screaming Dream (6a+)**  
Pleasant face climbing with a thuggy bulging start

**4. Semi Skimmed (6a+)**  
Short steep wall followed by easy ground and technical moves and long reach to belay

**5. Gold Top (6b)**  
Easy start then left-hand line of bolts with pleasant technicalities

**6. All gone Sour (6b) *★***  
Takes right-hand branch of bolts. Technical low down with plenty of climbing above

**7. The Cat that Got the Cream (6b+) *★***  
From behind tree climbs scoop and walls to ledge with fine headwall as finale.

**8. Past You Eyes (6b+) *★★***  
Fine central line of wall with plenty of pleasant climb throughout. Take care with hollow blocks at finale. DO NOT CLIMB. Top has fallen down.

**9. UHT (6b) *★***  
Branches off right from 4th bolt to reach easier ground and hanging groove above overlaps.

**10. Never Rub Another Man's Rhubarb (6b) *★***  
Counter line to UHT with ledgey start then excellent climbing culminating in a fine bulging finale on good holds
