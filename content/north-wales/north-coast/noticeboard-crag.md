Noticeboard Crag is a solid lump of rhyolite sat atop a prominent hillock and clearly visible from the A55. The rock is excellent and the climbing steep. Although covered in the North Wales Limestone guide the crag has since had a number of good quality routes added, mainly the work of Ian Carr and Martin Doyle.


## Approach

The crag is just a short way west of Conwy. 

Come off the A55 at junction 17 and head south on Bangor Road (A547) towards Conwy. After about a mile turn R onto Cadent Park. Follow this road around the the R then bear left after 70 metres. Take the first R into Mountain Road and park near the end of the road. 

The crag can be reached by following paths northwards up the hill to the back of the crag. Keep right towards the top to approach the crag on it's left side.
