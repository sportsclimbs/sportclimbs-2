Perhaps the classic hard crag of North Wales, Lower Pen Trywn or 'LPT' as it's more affectionately known, has been home to historic first ascents. Ben Moon's *Statement of Youth* was the country's first 8a and first fully bolted sport route in 1984. Less than a decade later Jerry Moffatt added *Liquid Ambar* now considered to be 8c+.
