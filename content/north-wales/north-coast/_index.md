The North Wales coastal region provides a wealth of excellent sport climbing from the fine limestone of the Ormes, various quarries, and other types of rock dotted around, mostly close to the A55 coast road.

For now we only have *The Gallery*: an unusual and excellent sport crag with grades from 6b+ to 7b+.

The plan is cover a lot more of this area in the future. For now there is an excellent guidebook to the area, *North Wales Limestone* which covers more than just the limestone of this area.
