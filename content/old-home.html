    <p>Welcome to the web pages of Sportsclimbs UK, a site created to support to sport-climbing in England and Wales.</p>
    <p>For those from further afield it is also intended to provide information to sport-climbing in the Peak and South Wales areas, together with photographs, maps and general crag information to tempt climbers into sampling some of the more 'backwater' cliffs of Britain. </p>

    <p>Please note the inclusion of a crag does not imply that you have the right to climb there. Some descriptions of climbs and sites are recorded for historical purposes only. Great effort has gone into this site to ensure that grades and descriptions are correct, but as always, climbers must use judgment to ensure that difficulties are within their capabilities and accept the consequence of their decision. This site is in no way an attempt to encourage climbers to climb on the cliffs described within. </p>

    <p> The publisher of this site in no way accepts any responsibility for any errors it may contain, nor are liable for any injuries or damages arising from its use. Climbing is a dangerous pastime. </p>
